Hi all, I'm trying to organize SENS information via a GitHub project (so it's easy for people to help SENS in a somewhat-coordinated way, for example using the right language and trying to persuade people in an effective way). If you're interested in helping, the project is located at https://github.com/NathanWailes/SENS.
