  - Q: *Do you think Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg might become a major player in terms of longevity funding?*
  - Aubrey's answer: *If his wife tells him it's OK ...*
  - Thoughts:
    - This connects with [another statement that Aubrey made](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-billionaires-that-support-the-SENS-agenda-not-really-funding-it) regarding why billionaires are not investing, in which he said, *"Sometimes their spouse is virulently opposed. (...) For each of the above reasons I could (but I wonâ€™t!) name at least one HNWI who I believe is substantially an example."*
    - So it seems that convincing Priscilla Chan may be important in order to convince Mark.
