### Message #001

Hello,

I am trying to find screenwriters who would be interested in depicting what it will look like when medicine has advanced to the point where aging has been eliminated as a cause of death (so people will continue to look like they're around 25, but will still die from accidents).

I am a volunteer for the SENS Research Foundation, which has thorough scientific evidence that we are closer than most people realize to this becoming a reality.  I can arrange to have the founder of SENS, Aubrey de Grey, answer questions that screenwriters may have about the details of what this will look like, and how soon it will happen, so that the writers will have an abundance of information to use to depict this.

Here are some links where you can learn more:
