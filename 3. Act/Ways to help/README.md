# Ways to help
- Upvote comments on various other websites (YouTube, Reddit, etc.) that reference this project or Aubrey / SENS in general.
  - See [Things to upvote.md](https://github.com/NathanWailes/SENS/blob/master/Take%20action/Ways%20to%20help/Things%20to%20upvote.md) for a list of things to upvote.
- Compile a list of YouTubers to reach out to, with the idea that we'd be asking them to create videos about Aubrey de Grey / SENS.
- Create an 'Every Aubrey de Grey Video' channel, like the similar channels for Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.
