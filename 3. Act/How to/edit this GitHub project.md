# Background / Why we're using GitHub
1. The information contained in this project is mostly text, and the most-common way to distribute the ability to make contributions to a collection of text files is via a wiki.
1. However, with wikis you need to worry about the quality of the contributions of the people you allow to make changes to the wiki.
    - There may be a way around this but I'm not aware of it. If you have ideas, email me at nathan.wailes@gmail.com.
1. The advantage of using a version-control system like git (which is the technology underlying GitHub) is that all changes can be reviewed before being allowed. This means that we don't need to limit the suggestion of changes to a selected team of people to ensure that the quality of the changes remains high.
