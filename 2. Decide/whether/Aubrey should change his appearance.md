- Elon Musk has certainly put a lot of attention into his appearance. His PayPal photo looks more like Aubrey's current appearance.
- Steve Jobs and Adolf Hitler were both *extremely* shoddy dressers until they got their opportunity to lead, at which time they put a lot of effort into cleaning up their appearance. Although Jobs is mostly known now for his turtleneck / jeans / sneakers look, when he first got started with the Apple 2 he was wearing suits.

# Comments from people about Aubrey's appearance

2017.10.09 - Reddit - Message from lord_stryker to Nathan Wailes
- *"I just see the way to get wealthy donations is to make his efforts on the front page of buzzfeed, facebook, with celebrity endorsements and **a good looking, well spoken, mature statesman of a scientist** who has solid credibility to be the front person. As much as I personally like Aubrey's style, it most definitely turns many people off."*
