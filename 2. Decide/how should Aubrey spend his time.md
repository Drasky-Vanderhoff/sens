# How Aubrey should spend his time on-stage
- The idea here is to investigate whether changing his standard speech might lead to better results.

#### Have a few simple main ideas that remain on-screen the entire speech

#### Repeat the few simple main ideas many times throughout the speech

#### End with a clear call-to-action
- For example, tell people to go *right now* to sens.org and submit their email address to receive more information about how they can help.
