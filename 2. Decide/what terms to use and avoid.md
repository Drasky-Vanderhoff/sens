# Terms to use

#### Health
- Aubrey seems to prefer the use of this term to words like 'immortality' and 'longevity' or 'thousand-year lifespans'.
- TODO: Get the quotes from Aubrey where he gives his reasoning for this.


# Terms to avoid

#### Cure
- I'm not sure about this one. I think I've heard Aubrey say that aging will never be "cured" the way that infectious diseases can be cured. But I'm not sure if that means that using the word "cure" should be avoided.

#### Longevity
- Aubrey says in his talks, "I work on health, not longevity".

##### Reasoning
- The word "longevity" by itself leads people to think that any extra years of life will be spent in a state of decrepitude.

#### Immortality
- Aubrey has said many times that he doesn't like the use of the term "immortality" to describe the goal.
- TODO: Gather all of the mentions of this in his speeches.
