# Terms to use

#### Health
- Aubrey seems to prefer the use of this term to words like 'immortality' and 'longevity' or 'thousand-year lifespans'.
- TODO: Get the quotes from Aubrey where he gives his reasoning for this.


# Terms to avoid

#### Cure
- I'm not sure about this one. I think I've heard Aubrey say that aging will never be "cured" the way that infectious diseases can be cured. But I'm not sure if that means that using the word "cure" should be avoided.

#### Disease
- Aubrey seems ambivalent about this term.
  - On the one hand, he thinks that the biogerontological community's distinguishing between the "diseases of old age" and "aging itself" is wrong, and that it would be more accurate to lump the two categories together, and thus he early-on seemed to like saying that all age-related problems are diseases.
    - "Aging is no more and no less than the *collective early stages* of the various age-related diseases." (Source: Ending Aging)
  - On the other hand, he doesn't like the idea of people thinking that age-related problems can be "cured" in the way that infectious diseases can be "cured" (i.e. the geriatric medicine approach), and for that reason he nowardays seems to avoid describing them as "diseases", instead preferring the word "damage".

#### Longevity
- Aubrey says in his talks, "I work on health, not longevity".

###### Reasoning
- The word "longevity" by itself leads people to think that any extra years of life will be spent in a state of decrepitude.

#### Immortality
- Aubrey has said many times that he doesn't like the use of the term "immortality" to describe the goal.
- TODO: Gather all of the mentions of this in his speeches.
