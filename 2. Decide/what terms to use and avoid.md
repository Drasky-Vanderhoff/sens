# Terms to use

#### Health
- Aubrey seems to prefer the use of this term to words like 'immortality' and 'longevity' or 'thousand-year lifespans'.
- One reason I've heard him give is that he wants people to realize that he's just advocating for straightforward medical research, just like all of the cancer research that everyone already supports.
- Honestly, I still don't feel like I fully understand what he's trying to convey with his "I work on health, not longevity" comments.
- TODO: Get the quotes from Aubrey where he mentions this.


# Terms to avoid

#### Immortality
- Aubrey has said many times that he doesn't like the use of the term "immortality" to describe the goal.
- This is probably the #1 word he doesn't like being used to describe his work.
- TODO: Gather all of the mentions of this in his speeches.

#### Longevity
- Aubrey says in his talks, "I work on health, not longevity".

###### Reasoning
- The word "longevity" by itself leads people to think that any extra years of life will be spent in a state of decrepitude.
- Saying they work on "longevity" also may lead people to think that what they're doing is very different from traditional medical research, which is not accurate, and may lead people to think it's not respectable / not scientific.
  - *"SENS is focused not on extending life per se, de Grey emphasizes, but rather on preventing and periodically repairing the various kinds of accumulated damage that produce the diseases and infirmities we now consider natural concomitants of old age."* ([Source](http://www.hhnmag.com/articles/3842-the-big-breakthrough-in-rejuvenative-medicine))

#### Cure
- I'm not sure about this one. I think I've heard Aubrey say that aging will never be "cured" the way that infectious diseases can be cured. But I'm not sure if that means that using the word "cure" should be avoided.

#### Disease
- Aubrey seems ambivalent about this term.
  - On the one hand, he thinks that the biogerontological community's distinguishing between the "diseases of old age" and "aging itself" is wrong, and that it would be more accurate to lump the two categories together, and thus he early-on seemed to like saying that all age-related problems are diseases.
    - "Aging is no more and no less than the *collective early stages* of the various age-related diseases." (Source: Ending Aging)
  - On the other hand, he doesn't like the idea of people thinking that age-related problems can be "cured" in the way that infectious diseases can be "cured" (i.e. the geriatric medicine approach), and for that reason he nowadays seems to prefer emphasizing the word "damage".
