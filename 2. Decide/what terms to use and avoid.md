# Terms to use

#### Health
- Aubrey seems to prefer the use of this term to words like 'immortality' and 'longevity' or 'thousand-year lifespans'.
- TODO: Get the quotes from Aubrey where he gives his reasoning for this.


# Terms to avoid

#### Longevity
- Aubrey says in his talks, "I work on health, not longevity".

##### Reasoning
- The word "longevity" by itself leads people to think that any extra years of life will be spent in a state of decrepitude.

#### Immortality
- Aubrey has said many times that he doesn't like the use of the term "immortality" to describe the goal.
- TODO: Gather all of the mentions of this in his speeches.
