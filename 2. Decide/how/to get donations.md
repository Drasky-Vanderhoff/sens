- [2016.07.19 - Reddit - Futurology - Aubrey AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4t65ay/aubrey_de_grey_ama_ask_about_the_quest_to_cure/d5ic190/)
  - > Q: Do you find that PR on curated media, like techie sites, leads to more donors or mainstream broadcasting like television shows?
  - > Aubrey: I'm not sure which leads to more - I think it's cumulative - **many donors need to hear the message many times before they become convinced enough to actually give.** Industry will certainly invest - indeed, that's already starting to happen.


# How to solve the free-rider problem

#### Use an assurance contract
- Related: [Lifespan.io](http://lifespan.io/)
  - The difference is that Lifespan.io focuses on individual projects rather than the problem as a whole. Thus it doesn't seem to really tackle the free-rider problem in the same way that a single over-arching assurance contract would.

##### Dominant assurance contracts
- The basic idea here is that some wealthy entrepreneur offers to pay potential-contributors if quorum isn't reached, in return for a cut of the collected money if quorum *is* reached. This incentivizes potential contributors to not sit out.
