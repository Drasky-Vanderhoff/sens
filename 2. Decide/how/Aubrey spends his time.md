# How Aubrey should spend his time when explaining SENS
- The idea here is to investigate whether changing his standard speech might lead to better results.
- We should gather analogies for the various parts of the argument that will appeal to various groups. Many times the software spaghetti code analogy falls flat because the majority of people in the audience don't know how to code.

#### Have a few simple main ideas that remain on-screen the entire speech

#### Repeat the few simple main ideas many times throughout the speech

#### End with a clear call-to-action
- For example, tell people to go *right now* to sens.org and submit their email address to receive more information about how they can help.
