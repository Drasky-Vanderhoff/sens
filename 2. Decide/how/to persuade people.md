  - > Rdapt85: Dr. De Grey, I constantly advocate for your work, and donate money myself. But the people I talk to aren't fully on board with what you do. I try to reason the best I can with people about why your work should be important to everyone. But people just seem to look past and don't make a sincere effort to give SENS the benefit of the doubt. How can I become more persuasive at getting people to understand why your work is critical? It seems like people bear the attitude that if it were that feasible, more people would be working on it already.

    > Aubrey: I wish there were an easy answer! **The basic problem is the herd mentality** - people know that if we could fix aging we would, but they also know that "everyone" thinks we can't, so even if they can't see any fatal flaw in your argument, it's easier for them to conclude that they are missing one than that "everyone" is just wrong. **The only solution to that is new data and repeat advertising.**
