- I don't want to simply assume that whatever ideas I come up with for things to work on are the best-possible use of my time (or the time of those who decide to help).


# Ideas
- We should have handouts, one page flyers or half pages flyers or card-sized flyers, that are designed to get people to want to learn more. Pay people to hand them out. You can do it in tourist areas in less-wealthy countries so that it's cheaper to hire people to hand out the flyers.
