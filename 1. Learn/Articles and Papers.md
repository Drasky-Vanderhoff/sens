   - This is a good summary of his argument.
   - Summary / Key Quotes:
     - **I estimate a 50% chance that they will arrive within 25 years given adequate funding.** I also explain why, even though these therapies will initially confer only perhaps 30 additional years of healthy life, those who benefit from them will very probably also benefit from progressively improved therapies, thereby maintaining “life extension escape velocity” and avoiding death from age-related causes at any age, with the result that (barring global catastrophe) many of them will attain four-digit lifespans.
     - **Aging is the set of side-effects of metabolism** that alter the composition of the body over time to make it progressively less capable of self-maintenance and thereby, eventually, progressively less functional.
     - As noted, we must also specify a degree of progress that can be considered an appropriate milestone. The one that I have championed in recent years, with the moniker **“Robust Mouse Rejuvenation” (RMR), is to treble the remaining average lifespan of a cohort of naturally long-lived mice that are already 2/3 through their natural lifespan before any intervention (whether genetic, pharmacological or dietary) is begun**. Long-lived mouse strains typically live to three years of age on average, so this means initiative a protocol on such mice at the age of two years and giving them an average age at death of five years.
     - **I recently proposed an anti-cancer strategy termed WILT (Whole-body Interdiction of Lengthening of Telomeres)** that is as ambitious as it is audacious: the use of both ex vivo and somatic gene therapy to delete the genes for telomerase and (as and when they are identified) ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) from as many of our cells as possible. This will have deleterious side effects that are obvious and daunting: telomere shortening will irresistibly eliminate the stem cell pools that maintain all our continually-renewing tissues, such as the blood, the gut and the skin. My proposal is to avert these consequences by periodic replenishment of our stem cell pools with new cells that also lack genes for telomere elongation but have had their telomeres extended ex vivo to normal lengths with exogenous telomerase.
     - **Once RMR is achieved, I am convinced that society’s attitude to the postponement of human aging will become unrecognisable.** I have therefore predicted that there is a 50% chance of our achieving a comparable advance in human life extension within 15 years after we achieve RMR. This human milestone, which I rather unimaginatively term “Robust Human Rejuvenation” or RHR, is not in my formulation precisely proportional to RMR: rather than a trebling of the remaining lifespan of people who are already 2/3 of the way to the prevailing average age at death, I define it as only a doubling. This means roughly 25-30 years of extra healthy life for people who are 55 when treatment begins.
     
       Why have I chosen a relatively toned-down version of RMR to define as RHR? Simply, because 25- 30 years is a familiar duration in the history of technology, and specifically in that part of the history of many technologies which, in respect of life extension, I will now discuss. How long does it take, following some fundamental technological breakthrough, for that technology to progress by incremental refinements to a stage beyond that which the architects of the original breakthrough could reasonably have contemplated? The answer seems rather reliably to be in the 20-30 year range. Lindbergh flew the Atlantic 24 years after the Wright brothers’ first flight. Commercial jetliners first flew 22 years after that, and supersonic airliners 20 years after that. In computing, the personal computer arrived about 28 years after the first electronic computer and the first convenient laptops arrived about 20 years later. In medicine, the discovery of antibiotics followed the publicising of the germ theory by about 30 years and was in turn followed, after another 25 years, by the development of methods to manufacture vaccines specific for a particular disease. [NW: This part doesn't sound very persuasive to me...]
       
       The implications of this pattern for the lives of people who are in middle age or younger at the time that RHR is achieved is clear, but no less dramatic for that. Put simply, there is a very high probability that the 25-30 years of good health conferred on its recipients by the first-generation panel of rejuvenation therapies (defined as those which achieve RHR) will suffice for the development of much more thorough and comprehensive therapies, capable of delivering more like a century of extra life to those who are in relatively good health at the time those therapies arrive. This is where the longevity escape velocity (LEV) concept arises. The recipients of the first-generation therapies – the ones that gave only around 30 years of extra healthy life – will, at least if sociopolitical pressures do not intervene, mostly also be among the beneficiaries of the secondgeneration ones, since they will be in the same degree of health at that time as they were when the first-generation therapies arrived. The same logic of course applies indefinitely into the future, just so long as the rate of progress in improving the comprehensiveness of the therapies continues to outstrip the rate at which the remaining imperfections in those therapies allow the accumulation of eventually pathogenic damage.

  - Rec'd by Aubrey [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/51wpds/aubrey_de_grey_matthew_oconnor_ama/d7jcpkf/) ("A particular favourite of mine on the more satirical side")
- [2010.10.19 - WIRED - How Beer, Oprah and Sergey Brin Can Help Cure Aging](http://www.wired.com/2010/10/aubrey-de-grey/)
  - Wired.com: The results from research into mouse longevity won’t necessarily be directly applicable to human biology. Nevertheless, you’ve made it clear such work is vital for getting someone like Oprah to help champion the anti-aging cause. When do you foresee yourself getting that kind of exposure?
    
    de Grey: Someone like Oprah is not really too keen to get too close in bed with people who don’t have mainstream credentials and authority. But it’s really changing fast. A month or two ago, one of my colleagues, Tony Atala, who runs an enormous group working in tissue engineering at Wake Forest, was on Oprah. He’s on my research advisory board and is associated with my journal and so on. Even though his work is not mainly focused on aging, the show was basically about aging. He was very, very gung-ho about the potential for regenerative medicine to postpone aging in the relatively foreseeable future.
    
    Wired.com: And mice are the key.
    
    de Grey: I do think it’s going to start with mice. What’s going to happen is the curmudgeons — the card-carrying gerontologists who think it’s very dangerous to be over-optimistic — will eventually recognize the data available to us from mice is so solid we can go out publicly and say, “It’s only a matter of time.” That’s going to take a panel of interventions in mice that’s so comprehensive we actually add two whole years to the lifespan of mice that are already in middle age before we start.
    
    That may be overcautious. We may be able to get gerontologists on board with a more modest result than that. However, at that point, game over. My job will be done. I can retire. Because that will be the point when Oprah will be all over it and the following day it will become impossible to get elected unless you have a manifesto commitment to have a war on aging.
    
    And there will be abundant people who are better than me at all the things I have to do at the moment, and I will no longer be necessary. And I shall fade away into glorious obscurity and you won’t be able to find me, even if you offer me a beer.
    
    Wired.com: Well, you’ll be in a pub probably.
    
    de Grey: Yes, but I won’t be in a pub with a journalist. [laughs]
    
    Wired.com: Two years ago, you told Wired.com that funding for your work was increasing every year. How has funding been since then?
    de Grey: Very uneven. Obviously, last year was particularly bad for everybody. It was certainly bad for us, too. But looking at the overall trajectory, we haven’t succeeded in getting as much as a doubling year-on-year and we are determined to catch up. This year we have hopes of doing better. The main reason for that is the big restructuring of the foundation.
    
    Wired.com: Right, what happened there?
    
    de Grey: In the beginning, the only thing the Methuselah Foundation did was the longevity prizes for mice. Then, we started funding research directly. We thought it was a really cool idea to have one organization with two very complementary approaches to the same mission. But in fact, it didn’t really work, especially not in terms of messaging.
    
    You want prizes to be ways to attract people who get scared when you talk about science for more than ten seconds. So the language has to be very glitzy and superficial and populist. Whereas, a foundation that’s trying to get money to put toward research, you want to look really knowledgeable and responsible and low-key.
    
    Eventually, we bit the bullet and split the foundation in two. Now they operate separately with no overlap of personnel at all. I’m not associated with the Methuselah Foundation anymore, except informally as an advisor. Conversely, SENS is optimizing our messaging and we feel good about how things are going, but certainly we need far more money. We have a big shopping list.
    
    Wired.com: Are you optimistic you’ll eventually get what you need?
    
    de Grey: The things I’m telling you now are exactly what I was saying, more or less, five years ago or more. And so you may be thinking, what’s wrong? Why isn’t this message working? I have had a lot of exposure, and a lot of success in calling the bluff of people who have politically motivated reasons to try to marginalize what I’m saying. Clearly, there are people out there who understand aging is bad for you. Just like me.
    
    So what’s missing? How come I haven’t got a lot of money?
    
    The answer is simply that you need three things for a high-net-worth individual to put money into something like this, whether it be as a donation or an investment: 1) You’ve got to believe the goal is valuable. 2) You’ve got to believe the plan to solve that goal is feasible or at least promising. 3) You’ve got to believe the organization you’re thinking of giving the money to actually has the ability to execute it. (NW: This is exactly what VCs talk about. They care more about the team than the idea.)
    
    That’s why I’m optimistic right now. Splitting the foundation is the first step toward that. It has allowed us to really refine our messaging, but it also means we were able to bring people in new people. Now, as a team, we can inspire a vastly greater amount of confidence in the people who already are familiar with what we do, but have been holding back.
    
    As far as I’m concerned, it’s a very good thing more research is going to be done on Parkinson’s Disease. Sergey Brin discovering he is susceptible to Parkinson’s and promptly began plugging some insane amount of money into research. It’s an absolute disgrace it takes personal risk to get someone as supposedly intelligent as Sergey Brin to actually do something. And the only excuse I can give him, since he’s been aware of my stuff since like 2003, is that he looked at me and my organization and said, “Hmm, like the goal. Like the plan. Don’t like the organization.” And he hasn’t told me this face to face, but that’s my guess.
    
    Wired.com: For most of the billionaire philanthropists that travel in the same circles you do, out of the three things, is it mainly that they just don’t like your organization?
    
    de Grey: I think for a very large, a very sufficient proportion of such people, yes, it’s that third thing. Because I see these people a lot. I go to TED, and there’s no holding back when it comes to 1) the desirability of the goal, and 2) the demonstration of sufficient comprehension of what I’m talking about to understand they believe the plan is feasible. So yes, absolutely.
    Wired.com: So it’s personal then?
    
    de Grey: I’d say it’s not even personal. When you’ve got a lot of money and people know you’ve got a lot of money, obviously everyone’s after it. You’ve got to have some way of deciding how to spend it.
    
    And I have a good deal of sympathy with the idea the Methuselah Foundation didn’t really give the right degree of professional persona that would give the right degree of confidence. It’s something we couldn’t necessarily fix overnight, either. It’s something that can only be built up over time, especially with management, the business side going out and actually communicating with these people the same way I have historically been. The Methuselah Foundation did look a bit too much like a simple fan club. I was the only person going out having any contact [with potential donors].
    
    (...)
    
    de Grey: I’ve found it frustrating the media, especially, are pretty much fixated on the longevity aspects and not on the health aspects. It wouldn’t annoy me so much if it was not so overdone. But even the most highbrow write-ups, like one inThe Economist a couple of years ago for example, every single one has the word “immortality” or “living forever” in the title of the article. It does wind me up a little bit.
    
    Wired.com: Why do you suppose they do that?
    
    de Grey: Sells papers. You don’t have to ask me, you’re the journalist.
    
    Wired.com: Press also helps get funding, no?
    
    de Grey: No, rather the opposite. It makes it sound like entertainment. It sounds like science fiction and not real science. It really actively detracts from my ability to get funding. (NW: Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that.)
    
    (...)
    
    Wired.com: There’s a good chance mitochondrial mutations may not necessarily be all that important to aging.
    
    de Grey: That’s right. Out of the seven things, that’s the only one where we cannot identify a particular major age-related pathology for which the thing in question is the dominant driver.
    
    Wired.com: Why put any time or resources towards solving a problem that may actually not be a problem?
    
    de Grey: That’s easy. Different experts are working on these different areas, so it’s not as though we’re taking any valuable resources away from one to put into another. And we’d feel pretty fucking silly if we fixed all these other six things and then people carried on dying on schedule and we found out we hadn’t actually taken the trouble to do the work to fix the problems with mitochondrial mutations at the same time. So my view has always been to be inclusive, to fix everything that might matter.
    
    Wired.com: On the other hand, cancer is probably going to be the toughest.
    
    de Grey: I feel that’s true, yes.
    
    Wired.com: Yet, it’s already an area with significant funding and research.
    
    de Grey: Well, you’ve got to look at it closely; 99.9 percent is going into ways in which we might delay cancer by 10 years. Which is a fine goal if you don’t expect to delay anything else by 10 years, right? But hello [laughs], it’s no good for me. So, to be perfectly honest, it’s a pretty stupid way of estimating the promise of a therapy in the first place.
    
    Even if things don’t move forward, incrementally they still move forward. And that’s why cancer has now caught up with cardiovascular disease in the U.S. as a cause of death. We need to put a little bit more money into the much more aggressive, longer-term, more ambitious but nevertheless eventually much more effective approaches that need to be explored. In particular, [OncoSENS] is in my view still the only game in town for a real solution to cancer.

  LE: You recently inherited a large sum of money and chose to donate most of it to the SENS Foundation. Will you provide some details and explain your motives?
  
  AdG: My mother died in May 2011 and I was her only child; the upshot is that **I inherited roughly $16.5 million**. Of that, I assigned $13 million to SENS (I won’t bore you with the legal details, which were tedious in the extreme). It was pretty much a no-brainer for me: I’ve dedicated my life to this mission, and I dedicate all my time to it, so why not my money too? I retained enough to buy a nice house, but beyond that I have inexpensive tastes and I have no doubt that this is the best use of my wealth.
  
  LE: Who are the other major donors to the SENS Foundation, and what proportion of the budget is covered by the money you donated?
  
  AdG: My donation will be spent over a period of about five years, and it roughly doubles the budget we had previously, from $2 million annually to $4 million. **The number one external donor remains our stalwart supporter Peter Thiel.** Additionally, another internet entrepreneur, Jason Hope, has recently begun to contribute comparable sums.
  
  (...)
  
  LE: What is advantageous and what is disadvantageous about the money spent on aging research by the National Institute on Aging (NIA, a branch of the US federal government’s National Institutes of Health)?
  
  AdG: It’s pretty much all advantageous - just not nearly as advantageous as it could be. **There is pitifully little money going into the search for interventions to postpone aging**, and of what there is, pitifully little is focused on late-onset interventions.
  
  (...)
  
  LE: For which of your SENS strategies would success achieve the most additional healthy years?
  
  AdG: **No one strategy would achieve very much on its own - certainly not as much as ten years, probably not even five.**
  LE: Which of the SENS strategies has the best prospect for success first?
  
  AdG: A couple of the strategies are already in clinical trials for some relevant conditions - stem cells for various things, including Parkinson’s disease, and vaccination against extracellular debris for Alzheimer’s.
  
  LE: Which of the SENS strategies would be the most difficult to achieve?
  
  AdG: I think it’s pretty clear that **the approaches for defeating cancer and for obviating mitochondrial mutations are the hardest, because they will both involve gene therapy, something we’re not at all good at yet.** Out of those two, I would say that the OncoSENS (the elimination of telomerase enzyme) is the harder, because it is much more complex and also because it involves gene targeting rather than just insertional gene therapy.

   - Summary / Key Quotes:
     - There was recently a report from the United Kingdom on the likely trajectory of anti-aging biomedical research.
     - Regenerative medicine [the approach SENS is advocating] was considered by the experts to have the greatest potential for delaying ageing.
     - However, throughout the article, discussions of longevity consist entirely of slowing aging down, rather than reversing it, as the term 'regenerative medicine' would imply.
     - **The painful truth is that most of my colleagues in the biogerontology community do not want to be associated with the prospect of what journalists insist on calling “immortality.” They are petrified of the “sticker shock” that such talk induces**—of the knee-jerk negative reactions that they see it inducing among those policy-makers upon whose favor their funding ultimately depends.
     - Why am I so sure of the above?
       - The "longevity escape velocity" concept is vastly *less* arguable than the current SENS program [repairing the seven types of damage in the next few decades and getting an extra 30 years of healthy life], and yet it elicits vastly *more* opprobrium.
       -  I see no alternative explanation for this abandonment of rationality, other than sheer rabbit-in-headlights petrification of association with an idea that might induce ridicule in the corridors of power.
     - What is to be done?
       - I will continue to give straight answers.
