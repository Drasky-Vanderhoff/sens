#### Why aren't rich donors donating to SENS?
- [Quora - Aubrey's answer to "Why are billionaires that support the SENS agenda not really funding it?"](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-billionaires-that-support-the-SENS-agenda-not-really-funding-it)
  - *Yeah… well, the thing about not funding someone is you don’t tend to be all that forthcoming about why you decided no… but my best inference is that **there is no one answer**, every HNWI is different. Sometimes they don’t think non-profits work. Sometimes they are scared that the approach is still unproven so they want to wait and see. Sometimes their spouse is virulently opposed. Sometimes they think other causes are more important. Sometimes they have a bad vibe about me personally. Sometimes they don’t like to do things that other HNWIs are not doing and they don’t consider Thiel to be a reliable first-mover. For each of the above reasons I could (but I won’t!) name at least one HNWI who I believe is substantially an example.*
- 2016.12.01 - Nathan Wailes - I asked Brian Acton about Aubrey today and it seems like there are two things: 1) rich people are busy, and are not allocating a lot of time to evaluate Aubrey's claims. 2) Brian said something to the effect that "I couldn't tell which of the life-extension people were charlatans and which weren't."


#### Does SENS have a list of the research projects that are now possible but are not being worked on for lack of funding?

###### Full question:
*Does SENS have a list of the research projects that are now possible but are not being worked on for lack of funding? And does it have a list of projects that are now underway? I'm basically wondering if there exists a kind of Gantt chart for all the different
issues that need to be taken care of (research that needs to be done, tools that need to be created, etc.).*

###### Response from Michael Rae:
We do have a list of projects that SENS Research Foundation ourselves either have underway, or have completed: you can see these under the Intramural, Extramural, and Past Projects links here:
http://www.sens.org/research/

However, we don't and really can't have a list of all projects that are underway in rejuvenation biotechnology (inclusive of all the work underway by government, academic, or biotech industry scientists), or the much larger amount of work that is  now possible but not being worked on for lack of funding, because there would just be too much of it (and, in the latter case, would be a constantly moving goalpost). We have regular meetings of our Research Development Committee, and at those we review recent and past proposals submitted to us by researchers through our Grant Submission Process (linked above), as well as review our own internal priorities and our budget.

I will certainly say that it would not be at all difficult to find enough priority projects that are being neglected by research organizations to invest 10-20 times our current budget.

#### [Aubrey says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=9m32s) that we could be moving three times faster if SENS had ten times as much funding. What's the reason for the non-1-to-1 relationship?

###### Response from Michael Rae:
Three things. First, there's just a law of diminishing returns. Our mitochondrial mutations team, for instance, could certainly go faster if we had more people and could always use the fastest ways of doing things rather than sometimes settling for more time-consuming methods that are cheaper to do — but there does come a point where simply throwing money at the problem doesn't get you any faster a result. I'm sure you're familiar with this kind of limitation from whatever kind of work you do.

Second, there is lag effect. Most of our existing projects are mature projects we've been working on for some time, have already generated some results, and could be made to progress even faster (to a point, as above) by throwing more resources at them. But NEW projects, of course, don't typically turn out results immediately, so as you on-board new projects, it takes a while before any tangible progress emerges.

And third, there is the fact that even if our budget were ramped up tenfold, we'd still only be a small organization embedded in the global health sciences research and development ecosystem. While we punch above our weight by focusing on critical-path projects that are neglected by others and key to achieving the specific goal of ending degenerative aging, the progress we make is none the less tied up with the progress of life sciences generally, of which we are a small part. If our capacities increase tenfold on a relative basis, that's still only 0.1% of (for instance) the NIH budget, let alone the global life sciences research community — and rather than ramping up, the NIH budget (to cite a salient example) continues to be eroded year by year by a *nominally* flat budget that is losing purchasing power every year due to biomedical inflation (and, in fact, this year has gone down even in nominal terms) So if our small budget increases in isolation, we can't accelerate as fast as we would if the whole ecosystem had a commensurate increase in its ability to make new discoveries and generate new tools and methods for us to use.
