#### Why aren't rich donors donating to SENS?
- [Quora - Aubrey's answer to "Why are billionaires that support the SENS agenda not really funding it?"](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-billionaires-that-support-the-SENS-agenda-not-really-funding-it)
  - *Yeah… well, the thing about not funding someone is you don’t tend to be all that forthcoming about why you decided no… but my best inference is that **there is no one answer**, every HNWI is different. Sometimes they don’t think non-profits work. Sometimes they are scared that the approach is still unproven so they want to wait and see. Sometimes their spouse is virulently opposed. Sometimes they think other causes are more important. Sometimes they have a bad vibe about me personally. Sometimes they don’t like to do things that other HNWIs are not doing and they don’t consider Thiel to be a reliable first-mover. For each of the above reasons I could (but I won’t!) name at least one HNWI who I believe is substantially an example.*
- 2016.12.01 - Nathan Wailes - I asked Brian Acton about Aubrey today and it seems like there are two things: 1) rich people are busy, and are not allocating a lot of time to evaluate Aubrey's claims. 2) Brian said something to the effect that "I couldn't tell which of the life-extension people were charlatans and which weren't."
