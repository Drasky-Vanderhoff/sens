  - Q: *Dr. De Grey, I finished reading your book Ending Aging (Thanks for the autographed copy by the way after my donation to MitoSENS) and have probably watched every single video of you on Youtube. I am 100% on board with your efforts and share your frustration of many in the the public actively fighting against your efforts. I agree with your assessment that people don't want to get their hopes up and rationalize why dying is a good thing.*
  
    *I donate monthly to SENS, I host monthly futurology-centric discussion panels where we watch a short video and discuss the topic. I have shown your TED talks on several occasions.*

    ***My question for you is, what more can I do?** If I won the lottery, SENS would be getting a multi-million dollar cheque. I'm not a biologist (computer engineer) and I'm saddened I'm not able to do more to quicken what will be mankind's greatest achievement -- the end of suffering due to aging. I know you espouse outreach to get the message out, and I'm doing my best, but I can't help thinking there is more I can do.*
   - Aubrey didn't reply.
   - Harolo Silva of OncoSENS replied: *Thank you so much for supporting our work both financially and by spreading our message!*
