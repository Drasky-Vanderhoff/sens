# Background
- The idea here is to gather evidence that Aubrey is not mobilizing / leading those whom he has convinced in a coordinated way.
- Aubrey does not seem to end his speeches / talks with a clear call-to-action to join his effort (e.g. "I WANT *YOU* FOR U.S. ARMY--NEAREST RECRUITING STATION"). Instead he tells people to "go out and advocate".
- The problem is that I suspect most people want to act as part of a coordinated effort rather than acting alone.
- People also aren't being trained / equipped to advocate effectively.
- This vaccuum seems to be leading to a splintering of efforts. There are a bunch of different groups.

# Evidence

- [2016.07.18 - Reddit - Futurology - Aubrey de Grey AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4t65ay/aubrey_de_grey_ama_ask_about_the_quest_to_cure/d5gtnna/)
  - Q: *Dr. De Grey, I finished reading your book Ending Aging (Thanks for the autographed copy by the way after my donation to MitoSENS) and have probably watched every single video of you on Youtube. I am 100% on board with your efforts and share your frustration of many in the the public actively fighting against your efforts. I agree with your assessment that people don't want to get their hopes up and rationalize why dying is a good thing.*
  
    *I donate monthly to SENS, I host monthly futurology-centric discussion panels where we watch a short video and discuss the topic. I have shown your TED talks on several occasions.*

    ***My question for you is, what more can I do?** If I won the lottery, SENS would be getting a multi-million dollar cheque. I'm not a biologist (computer engineer) and I'm saddened I'm not able to do more to quicken what will be mankind's greatest achievement -- the end of suffering due to aging. I know you espouse outreach to get the message out, and I'm doing my best, but I can't help thinking there is more I can do.*
   - Aubrey didn't reply.
   - Harolo Silva of OncoSENS replied: *Thank you so much for supporting our work both financially and by spreading our message!*

  - The question starts at 37:48.
  - > Aubrey: OK <he points to the questioner>, you were first.

    > Q: Do you have, say, a packet of material on your website, or something like that? Hearing you is great, and I've read you, and all that stuff, but what are the arguments? What are the facts that I can present to someone who has that <inaudible>?
    >
    > Ok, great. So, yes, we *kinda* do...But actually, I used to have an FAQ on my own personal website way back when I used to work at Cambridge, like 15 years ago, answering these questions, and somehow or other it didn't look glitzy enough, so people took it down. But yeah, the answers are all there on our website, and certainly if there's any particular challenge to the desirability of fixing aging that you feel--you've had some discussion with somebody and you couldn't find the right answer--what you can absolutely always do is write to us, and say, "How should I have answered this question?" Ultimately, the best thing...you don't have to be physically in the same room as me to hear my answers; I am all over YouTube, so you can always just look at a lot of what I've said to people on-stage.
