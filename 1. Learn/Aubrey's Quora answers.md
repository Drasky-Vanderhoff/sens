# Background
- The idea here is to gather Aubrey's answers to Quora questions so that they can be searched more easily.
- Note that the goal is to *only* have those of his answers that are relevant to SENS. Aubrey also talks about mathematics on Quora, and that generally won't be of interest to us.
- Newer questions at the bottom.
  - It isn't clear to me whether it's better to have them at the bottom or the top.
- It would be nice to have a Python script that would scrape these automatically and store them at some easily-accessible URL...
- The script would ideally get not only the answers, but also Aubrey's responses to comments.

# Questions

##### What is the significance of the failure of monoclonal antibodies that remove amyloid beta as an attempt to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease to longevity research?
2017.09.25 - Less than most commentators say. Abeta may or may not be causative in AD, and if it is there are many ways in which it could be, but the important thing to remember is that AD is complicated, which means that the repair of more than one of its features may deliver more than the sum of the benefits arising from repairing each one in isolation. We have Abeta removal in our back pocket now as a tool that can be combined with other tools (such as tau removal) as and when the latter are developed. Whether it’s needed remains to be seen, but I’m very happy that we now have the option.

##### Why are billionaires that support the SENS agenda not really funding it?
2017.09.25 - Yeah… well, the thing about not funding someone is you don’t tend to be all that forthcoming about why you decided no… but my best inference is that there is no one answer, every HNWI is different. Sometimes they don’t think non-profits work. Sometimes they are scared that the approach is still unproven so they want to wait and see. Sometimes their spouse is virulently opposed. Sometimes they think other causes are more important. Sometimes they have a bad vibe about me personally. Sometimes they don’t like to do things that other HNWIs are not doing and they don’t consider Thiel to be a reliable first-mover. For each of the above reasons I could (but I won’t!) name at least one HNWI who I believe is substantially an example.

##### How much money does Aubrey de Grey need to find a cure?
2017.09.22 - Short answer: $1 billion over 10 years would do it with high probability.

Longer answer: clearly the question is not whether but when aging will be brought under comprehensive medical control. Thus, the right question is how much money is needed, over what time period, to hasten that time to the point where money will not make much difference any more because the rate of progress is limited by the simple difficulty of the research. See above for the number!

Key other number: at current funding levels we are going so slowly that (by my current estimate) we could easily end up delaying the defeat of aging by a decade. Therefore, even low-balling the expectations, every $2 spent in supporting this work would save a life. That compares very favourably with anything else.

##### What's been the progress, if any, on the WILT (Whole-body interdiction of the lengthening of telomeres) strategy?
2017.07.23 - It’s been slow but steady. On the telomere control side, other groups have made nice progress in inhibiting telomerase-mediated elongation (see especially Jerry Shay’s 2015 paper on 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine) and we have developed a much faster and cheaper assay for ALT that will facilitate the discovery of anti-ALT drugs. On the stem cell replacement side, we funded a study to look for the ability of early-generation telomerase-knockout haematopoietic stem cells to rescue longevity in late-generation telomerase knockout mice, and it worked (it was tricky because we needed to rescue their gut problems with another mutation) but we could only afford to do a small study so we barely made it to statistical significance and we haven’t published it. Our parallel work on the gut, led by Graca Almeida-Porada at Wake Forest, made modest progress but unfortunately we have had to suspend that project because of lack of funds.

I remain hopeful that we can get WILT to work - but I also remain hopeful that we won’t need to, because simpler therapies will work well enough. In particular, the progress in cancer immunotherapy over recent years has been dramatic, and it might just be enough to make WILT unnecessary. We won’t stop working on WILT until we’re sure that that is the case, though!

##### Do induced pluripotent stem cells reverse the intracellular junk that accumulates with aging?
2017.05.25 - Sure they do, but not because they are pluripotent: simply because the divide. Cell division shares out any junk between the daughter cells, so it dilutes it away.

##### Aubrey de Grey, what do you mean by "longevity escape velocity"?
2017.05.26 - The thing you’re overlooking is that the “first-generation” panel of rejuvenation therapies will not be perfect: it will mostly plug the gaps that evolution has left in our in-built damage-repair machinery, but it won’t do so 100%. (Let’s just define the damage that it does repair as the easy damage and the rest as the difficult damage.) There is nothing to stop us from applying those therapies every year, never mind every 30 years - but because of their incompleteness, however often we apply them we will still get back to biologically the same age (i.e., we’ll be carrying the same quantity of damage) at some point (I generally guess chronological age 90, but that’s a total guess) as we were just before we first applied the therapies. And the problem is, that the overwhelming majority of the damage that is present at that point will be difficult damage.

Thus, the only way we will be able to re-rejuvenate these people is if we have improved the therapies. And of course this carries on being true until such time as the therapies become truly 100% comprehensive, which quite probably will never happen. Hence the need to keep pushing ever closer towards that probably-unachievable goal. LEV is simple the minimum pace at which we need to do that, in order to keep one step ahead of the problem.

The good news is that LEV slows down as time passes, because the smaller the remaining gaps in the therapies, the longer it takes for that still-too-difficult damage to become abundant enough to make us sick.
