#### [2011.01.27 - New Cancer Mentality - Aubrey de Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc8YzPZRxM8)
##### Part 1
- 0:40 - **Cancer is the hardest part of aging to fix**, and **it may be worth pursuing strategies that exacerbate other aspects of aging because we can treat those other issues more easily than we can deal with cancer**.
- 1:22 - The big mistake we may have been making is to try to distinguish between cancer cells and noncancerous cells.
- 2:30 - So what we want is to find something that's harmless to both cells and noncancerous cells for several years. The obvious candidate was telomere shortening.
- 3:19 - Once we've developed gene therapy, we could use gene targeting to delete the genes for telomerase for both cancer cells and noncancer cells.
- 4:10 - This would have enormous side-effects. Various body systems would fail very quickly. They'd probably only last 10 years. But that might be OK. We could keep those systems going with periodic stem cell replenishment.
- 5:35 - It's an extremely challenging proposal. It's the hardest component of his proposal to defeat aging. He's hopeful it won't be necessary.
- 6:20 - People were hopeful 40 years ago about defeating cancer, and they were wrong. **We should not limit ourselves today to just those approaches which seem most promising, because they may turn out to not work; we should also also be pursuing much-more ambitious / aggressive approaches.**
- 6:55 - Explanation of what telomeres are.

##### Part 2
- 0:00 Are there any other roles for telomerase? [I guess that would make it not plausible to just get rid of telomerase.]
- A: There are some studies. In humans, cells either have no telomerase or as little as possible. So that suggests any role that telomerase plays in other organisms
- 2:00 - Can we already knock out telomerase?
- A: We can do it in cells in culture, but we haven't gotten to the point where we can do it in humans. It's going to take a lot of work to get it working.
- 3:15 - How can we get more collaboration?
- A: More money. The problem is scientists perceive that the best way to get funded is to stick to what their speciality is. That leads to excessive specialization. People like me, who are just keeping an eye on the big picture, are much more necessary. One of the reasons that I moved into this field was that I observed that there were no theoretical biologists in the way that there are theoretical physicists.
- 5:20 - Q: Are pharma companies on the wrong path?
- A: They're looking for opportunities that can be commercialized immediately. We need funding for research that can't be immediately commercialized.
- 6:10 - Q: What would you say to people who need treatment now [for cancer]?
- A: (He seemed to dodge the question, since the answer is most likely, "These treatments won't arrive in time for them.")
- 7:18 - **Immunotherapy for cancer is a promising area that is not being pursued as aggressively as it could be.**
- 7:40 - Q: What would you tell people who are doing experiments looking at the whole genome?
- A: I think some of the research is useful, and some of it is not useful.

- He thinks **a realistic goal for 2025 is to be able to take middle-aged mice and extend their remaining lifespan by 2 or 3 times**. For example, you take mice that normally live 3 years, do nothing until they're 2 years old, and then apply therapies that will make the mice live until they're 4 or 5.

#### [2014.04.07 - Talks at Google - Ending Aging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXJzvo0Jekc)
- 7:30 - He explains the misconception of thinking of aging itself as being separate from the diseases of old age (like alzheimer's).
- 8:30 - He explains that you can't "cure" the diseases of old age in the same way you can cure tuberculosis, because the diseases of old age are side-effects of being alive, and so as long as you're alive you will have damage accumulating.
- 9:30 - He shows a graph that shows the mistaken division between what people think of old age (frailty) and the diseases of old age.
- 11-11:30 - He says that the geriatric approach is to fight the symptoms and hope that the disease will be cured. But he says it's obvious that won't work because the damage will continue to accrue.
- 12:30 - He explains another approach, which tries to clean up how the body works so that damage won't accumulate. He explains that the problem with this approach is that the body is incredibly complicated.
- 14:55 - He introduces his car maintenance example. He shows a car that is 100 years old and still looks new.
- 16:00 - He then explains his approach: go in and repair damage. Don't try to stop damage from happening. Don't just try to treat the symptoms of damage.
- 17:10 - He explains the seven sub-problems which need to be solved to make his approach work.
- 18:25 - 1. Cell loss: cells die and aren't replaced
- 18:44 - 2. Too many cells (eg cancer)
- 19:30 - 3. Mitochondrial mutations
- 20:10 - 4. Intracellular junk / garbage not being removed from cells
- 20:50 - 5. Extracellular junk
- 21:10 - 6. Extracellular matrix stiffening
- 22:00 - Someone asks him whether we'll ever need to fix cellular mutations. de Grey says it's so rare that we won't need to worry about it in our current lifespans, except for cancer, which he has in another spot.
- 23:00 - He makes the point that if we can implement the maintenance approach properly, we won't need to know all about how the body works.
- 24:55 - He addresses the question of whether his list of seven problems is exhaustive. He says that it has been the same list since 1982. He has been challenging people since 2002 to add to the list and hasn't had anyone bring up any new items.
- ~27-30 - He goes through how heart disease, alzheimer's, and frailty correspond to the seven categories
- 30:40 - He explains the four methods of solving these seven categories of problems: replace, reinforce
- 32-34 - He talks about parkinson's as an example of using the four Rs. He mentions that the short-term incentives of researchers made them give up for a long time on trying to do research in this.
- 33:40 - He thinks we are in such a good position that we might have a true cure for parkinson's within 10 years
- 36:50 - He makes the point that longevity is a side-effect of health. He isn't focused on longevity.
- 37 - 
- 38:20 - He explains that there is increasing interest from the private sector. He describes Calico.
- 39:30 - He describes "Human Longevity Inc."
- 40:00 - He says that the problem is not yet being worked on in a comprehensive manner. He says SENS is good to keep an eye on what things are being neglected.
- 41-43 - He gives an example of the kind of research that SENS itself does.
- 47 - He explains the idea of how imperfect technology which buys us 30 years of extra life could give us enough time to refine the treatments enough to make them much more effective.
- 49 - He introduces the term "longevity escape velocity"
- 50:20 - He introduces the idea that within 10 years people are going to realize that there is a real chance of this working.
- 53:53 - He ends his talk and switches to questions
- 54 - Q: If we just fixed one thing and didn't fix the other things, would there be secondary benefits for the other problems?
  - A: Yes, but the question is how 
- 56:10 - Q: 
- 56:30 - Q: What do you think it will cost to do the necessary research?
  - A: The money will get much bigger at later stages, but he doesn't worry about it b/c once they get dramatic results in mice the money will surge in from governments etc. He says $100 million per year for 10 years.
- 57:40 - Q: Are there parts of the body that aren't designed to be rejuvenated? For example, teeth.
  - A: He says yes, but those
- 58:20 - Q: We haven't done very well with maximum lifespan, which makes it seem like there are other mechanisms other than damage.
  - A: ...
- He says it's strange that no one has beaten the world-record for age of 122 years.
- 1:00:50 - Q: Do you think about nanobots?
  - A: He thinks they have a very good prospect of playing an increasing role as time goes on.
- 1:01:40 - Q: Is aging programmed?
  - A: The consensus is "No", but a long time ago it was thought the answer was "Yes".
- 1:03:40 - Q: What about calorie restriction?
  - A: We have less impressive machinery than mice and nematodes to respond to calorie restriction by slowing metabolic processes.

#### [2014.05.08 - St. Gallen Symposium - One-on-One: an investigative interview with Aubrey de Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkBfT_EPBIo)

#### [2014.07.28 - Talks at Google - Aubrey de Grey: "The Science of Ending Aging"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3DW6-xzLc)
- *"My estimate is this: **I think we have at least a 50-50 chance of getting the technologies that I described today working reasonably well within the next 20 to 25 years.** And **the technologies that I described today, I think will probably give about 30 additional years of healthy life, and of course they will give those years to people who are already in middle age or older, 60, 70, or even maybe 80, at the time that the therapies arrive.** So that means most people in this room have a relatively good chance of benefiting. Two caveats: First caveat: **Everything I just said is only going to be true if research in the next 5 or 10 years goes a lot faster than it's currently going.** The funding limitation that exists at the moment, I estimate, is slowing things down by roughly a factor of 3. In other words, over the past 10 years, the amount of progress we've made towards getting proof-of-concept of these things in the lab and so on has probably only advanced by about 3 years relative to how well it could have gone if only science had been limiting. The second caveat is the probabilities: so, I can tell you a 50-50 estimate, but I will tell you right now the variance is high. I think that there's at least a 10% chance that we won't get there for a hundred years. But who cares? A 50% chance is perfectly enough to be worth fighting for.*
- *Question: About a year ago there was set up this company called "Calico", the California life company, we set it up to work independently. And I was just wondering: First of all, how do you view this development? And secondly, have you had the chance to work with them so far?*
  - *Answer: Yeah, actually I was very surprised that no one at the talk I gave at lunchtime asked about Calico. But yes, Calico was set up by Larry and Sergey about a year ago...and, well, my view of that development was expressed in Time magazine, which was where the thing was announced. Time got me to write the reaction piece, so to speak, and I was...pretty effusive. I was overjoyed. And I still am. **I think that there is a very respectable chance that they will make a really big difference. But only a chance. It just remains to be seen.** They are taking their own really good time to decide exactly where they're going to be prioritizing their efforts. And in a way that's a good thing. The worst thing that could possibly happen would have been a repeat of what happened 15 years ago when another very wealthy individual, Larry Ellison, decides to do essentially the same thing, albeit in a foundation rather than a company. He basically went out and promptly hired a veteran gerontologist from the NIA, and the result was completely predictable: 15 years and $400 million later, absolutely nothing had been done that wouldn't have been done anyway. And he's given up now. So Calico is potentially a really good thing: they've got people at the top who are by-and-large not trained gerontologists, and therefore they know what they don't know; they're making their own decisions. **They're not talking to us nearly as much as we'd like them to, and as we think they should be**, but...that may change. So I'm hopeful.*

#### [2017.06.01 - YouTube - Dr. Aubrey de Grey Interview : Controlling the Main Aging Damages - Where Are We Now?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FedFqQ-a11M)
- 0:18 - Q: There are several main damages to find by SENS system; what about the progress in each direction? If you don't mind, let's begin with the least-developed areas.
  - A: So, **it's really good news right now**, actually. The situation maybe two years ago was that there were two areas that had made hardly any progress for the previous decade. One of them was MITOSENS, dealing with mitochondrial mutations, and the other was GLYCOSENS, the crosslink problem, where the extracellular matrix becomes less elastic. In both those cases, over the past two years, we have seen really good progress, it's got everything moving again. (...) On the mitochondrial side...I think **at this point, everybody is taking us seriously, everybody is taking the idea seriously, it's a very different world than it was even two years ago.**
- 3:18 - Q: What about the most-developed areas; what we could expect–when we could expect an intervention for humans appear? Probably it will be some next decades for some damages...?
  - A: Well, actually, **things are going really fast in a lot of areas now.**

#### [2017.08.31 - Demography Today - Aubrey de Grey - How old can we get?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WShyvsfszx0)
- He talks about how more and more people are reaching 60, 70, 80, 90.
- 7:44 - Q: Why aren't we constantly beating the world-record for longevity?
- 9:30 - He tells the story of Izumi, a Japanese man listed in the Guiness book of records as the second-oldest person ever, and it turned out to be his brother.
- 10:30 - Recordkeeping is getting better, but the oldest people were still born in times when recordkeeping was bad.
- 11:30 - The reason we need accurate data is to be able to identify trends.
- 11:40 - You especially want to avoid systematic bias.
- 13:24 - Q: So who should do the verifying? A: The Los Angeles Gerontology Research Group. They're 'amateurs' but they're very good at what they do.
- 15:20 - There's a problem: Most published (academic) analyses of super-centenarian data are spectacularly bad.
  - He goes into a particular example of a paper that was published in Nature.
- 17:40 - It's not clear that it's possible to derive conclusions from super-centenarian data since there's so little of it.
- 18:18 - Main idea of the talk: "Actually, we can do a lot more in terms of the analysis of this small amount of data than people have previously realized."
- 18:35 - When you study the ages of death of people in a given population, what you are really trying to do is extract from the data the risk of (probability of) death at any given age, which is called the mortality rate.
- 19:25 - It turns out to be hard to do that with small amounts of data. With large amounts of data, you can just the straightforward approach of seeing what proportion of people survived the year.
- 20:39 - With small amounts of data, you have a tension between granularity and scatter.
  - "Scatter" is the deviation of each bucket's data-point from the bucket's underlying "true probability".
    - Example not from the video: if you only have one person of age 110, and he survives to his 111th birthday, using a one-year bucket would result in a datapoint for age 110 of a 100% probability of surviving.
  - "Granularity" is the ability to detect deviations of particular time-frames' underlying mortality rate from the longer-term trend.
    - Example not from the video: If people are more likely to die in college, but you use a bucket size of ten years (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, etc.), then that truth may not be easy to spot.
- 21:00-28:00 - He explains how he took a standard demography equation and did some manipulations to it that allowed him to make some new discovery. I should write up in detail what he said.
- 32:10 - Q: Can we find anything out using this new analysis?
- 37:40 - Why am I coming here to talk about this?
- 41:00 - Q: How might we move forward medically?
- He spends a few minutes giving a short version of his standard TED talk: human aging is like the aging of any machine in that it's caused by damage, previous attempts to treat aging were going about it the wrong way, we have reason to believe we know all of the different kinds of damage that accumulate, and we have reason to believe that we can develop complete treatments for all of these different types of damage.
- 47:40 - He concludes with his big claim (big to demographers): you cannot predict longevity from this point on (which is their job) by relying solely on trend lines generated by past or present deaths. You must also pay attention to the new therapies being developed in laboratories around the world and try to estimate the effect these therapies will have on lifespans.
