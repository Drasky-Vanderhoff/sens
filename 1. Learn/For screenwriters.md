#### Can you either list or direct us to a place where we can get a list of messages that 1) you'd like the public to get (i.e. things you'd like them to learn), and 2) misconceptions you'd like to dispel or avoid furthering? For example, you might want the public to get the message that we can achieve the first round of therapies in twenty years' time, and you might want to dispel / avoid propagating the idea that these therapies will only ever be for the rich.


# Timelines

#### Can you give us a detailed (obviously speculative) timeline of when various major events relevant to these therapies are likely to happen?


# People

#### My understanding is that these therapies will be done intermittently. So if they're done every 10 years, will people appear to age to 35, and then have a treatment of therapies that "bring them back" to looking like they're 25?


## Behavior

#### Do you have any reason to believe that people's behavior will be different in connection with these therapies? Obviously "more energy" and all of the other behaviors associated with youthfulness, but any aside from that? For example, cancer patients currently dread doing their chemo sessions, and people who take various medications experience behavioral side-effects.


#### Do you suspect that people may end up being forgetful about how old they are since it will no longer be important? For example, nowadays it might not be seen as unusual for a person to not remember their social security number or debit card number.


## Clothing

#### Do you have reason to believe that people may need to wear any particular clothing or devices at any time in connection with these therapies?

# Buildings and their interiors

#### Do you have reason to believe that people may need to live in buildings that have particular constraints on them or their contents in connection with these therapies? For example, will people need to stay in a hospital at any point, or need to stay in a home that has particular devices in it?

#### What accomodations, if any, would you expect to see disappear or not disappear as a result of these technologies? For example, would ramps be removed or not mandatory at buildings? Would elevators no longer be mandatory in buildings?


# What will the application of these therapies look like?

#### How frequently will each of the different therapies be done?


# Plots / Conflicts

#### Do you have suggestions for plots that will not lead the audience to fear rejuvenation tech? For example, in Back to the Future Part 2, the flying cars are not depicted as the source of any problems.
