The idea here is to gather all of the articles, videos, etc. that criticize SENS, Aubrey, etc. And then hopefully also have a separate organization of all of this information by the particular argument being made, so that it's easy for newcomers to look up a criticism they have and see what Aubrey's response is.

## The practicality of ending aging / SENS


## Aubrey

### Aubrey lives an unhealthy lifestyle
- He drinks ~3 pints of beer a day.
- He doesn't exercise.

##### Response
- Aubrey has some gene that allows him to handle alcohol relatively well, such that he's made a considered decision to enjoy it.
- He has also thoroughly examined the research on lifestyle and learned that living a very-strictly-healthy lifestyle only modestly improves life span (by say ~2 years) over living a merely "fairly" healthy lifestyle (i.e. not being overweight).
- TODO: Get some official sources (recorded clips of Aubrey speaking).

#### [2005.11 - EMBO Reports - Science fact and the SENS agenda](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1371037/?tool=pubmed)

###### Summary
- In an article published in the EMBO reports Special Issue on Time and Ageing, Aubrey de Grey criticizes biogerontologists for what he sees as their generally pessimistic view of the possibilities for intervening in the ageing process.
- In the words of the great American journalist H.L. Mencken, "for every complex problem, there is a simple solution, and it is wrong."
- In his writings, de Grey fails to mention that none of his proposed therapeutic approaches has ever been shown to extend the lifespan of any organism, let alone humans.
- To explain to a layman why de Grey's programme falls into the realm of fantasy rather than science requires time, attention and the presentation of detailed background information.
- Response to particular SENS-suggested therapies:
  - Those among us who are immunologists recognize that the few tests of the idea that interleukin 7 (IL-7) can improve protective immunity have produced disappointing results so far. Learning how to integrate IL-7 into preventive medicine will take decades of hard work, if it ever proves to be useful.
  - Similarly, those of us who work on cancer know that the inhibition of telomerase is one among many interesting ideas that might, one day, help to control some forms of human neoplasia. However, we also know that the ablation of telomerase activity might have serious side effects on stem-cell and lymphocyte function, might fail to work in some tumour types, might select for neoplastic cells with alternative ways to avoid growth inhibition, and has not yet been shown to prevent or treat cancer either in humans or in animal models.
  - Genetically engineered muscle cells might one day prove useful as sources of needed hormones or systemic factors, but the use of such an approach to slow ageing, let alone to reverse it, must confront the plain fact that, at present, no one knows which hormonal changes might be needed, in what tissues and at what intervals, to accomplish such a miracle.
  - As far as we know, “senescence marker-tagged toxins” do not yet exist. Moreover, if they did, it is uncertain whether they would do more harm than good.
- Most therapeutic ideas, even the most plausible, come to nothing—in pre-clinical studies or clinical research, the proposed interventions are found to be toxic or induce unwelcome side effects, are mooted by more successful ideas, or, most often, simply fail to work as hoped.
- Each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic. Therefore, by multiplying the probabilities of success, the claim that all of these proposals can be accomplished, although presented with confidence in de Grey's writings, seems nonsensical.
- Consequently, the idea that a research programme organized around the SENS agenda will not only retard ageing, but also reverse it—creating young people from old ones—and do so within our lifetime, is so far from plausible that it commands no respect at all within the informed scientific community.
- <They go through various things that they *do* believe are possible.>
  - We are all familiar with the unambiguous evidence from numerous laboratories showing that ageing can be slowed sufficiently to increase longevity by 30 or 40% in mammals. Moreover, we believe that learning how to do similar things for humans might lead to impressive improvements in public health, with extra decades of active disease-free lifespan as a plausible, although by no means certain, goal.
- None of us believes that plans to 'engineer' the body to prevent ageing indefinitely or to turn old people young again have the remotest chance of success.
- Although it is foolhardy to try to 'prove' that a particular engineering problem can never be solved, we can and must insist that speculation based on evidence be discriminated from speculation based on wish fulfilment alone, and recommend that research programmes should be based on fact and extrapolation from earlier successes and failures.
- Ageing research is a discipline that is only just emerging from a reputation for charlatanry. We are concerned when we see scientific journals and meetings give space and attention to empty fantasies of immortality, artfully camouflaged under the guise of research proposals.
- Why not simply debate with de Grey and let the most convincing arguments win? It is our opinion that pretending that such a collection of ill-founded speculations is a useful topic for debate, let alone a serious guide to research planning, does more harm than good both for science and for society.
- [Regarding creationism, Richard] Dawkins argues that engaging in such jousting contests might be a bad idea, in that such spectacles create, in the arena of public opinion, the misleading impression that biologists consider the 'arguments' of creationists sufficiently meritorious to require public discussion.
- Dawkins points out that the scientific community has developed a better way to discriminate among competing ideas: testing them experimentally.
- If de Grey believes that he has a good strategy to reverse the ageing process, he should devise a detailed plan for testing his ideas, and then, like the rest of us, convince sponsors that his project deserves funding.
- In our opinion, the items of the SENS programme in which de Grey expresses such blithe confidence are not yet sufficiently well formulated or justified to serve as a useful framework for scientific debate, let alone research.
###### Aubrey's response: [Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1371043/)
- Warner et al. dismiss SENS as 'scientifically' unrealistic, but they forget that engineering—of which life extension will be an example, as all medicine is—differs profoundly from science in its goals, methods and skills.
- Their knowledge of SENS is woeful.

 - > Q: UC Irvine evolutionary biologist Dr. Michael Rose has been critical of SENS, claiming it is far too reductionist in its approach (meaning that biology is more than just machinery assembled from parts). How would you respond?
 - > Aubrey: Well, that's not precisely what he says, but yes, he thinks that his Drosophila findings (specifically the "plateauing" of mortality rates) imply that organisms must have a system for shutting off the accumulation of life-threatening damage. I've explained repeatedly to him, including in print, that this doesn't follow, and that his belief that his results can only be explained that way arises from a basic mathematical error that he made about 20 years ago and has never been willing to admit to, compounded by another one about 10 years ago. It also doesn't help that he holds the additional mistaken belief that evolutionary theory predicts this "late-life non-aging".
