The idea here is to gather all of the articles, videos, etc. that criticize SENS, Aubrey, etc. And then hopefully also have a separate organization of all of this information by the particular argument being made, so that it's easy for newcomers to look up a criticism they have and see what Aubrey's response is.

###### Summary
- In an article published in the EMBO reports Special Issue on Time and Ageing, Aubrey de Grey criticizes biogerontologists for what he sees as their generally pessimistic view of the possibilities for intervening in the ageing process.
- In the words of the great American journalist H.L. Mencken, "for every complex problem, there is a simple solution, and it is wrong."
- In his writings, de Grey fails to mention that none of his proposed therapeutic approaches has ever been shown to extend the lifespan of any organism, let alone humans.
- To explain to a layman why de Grey's programme falls into the realm of fantasy rather than science requires time, attention and the presentation of detailed background information.
- Most therapeutic ideas, even the most plausible, come to nothing—in pre-clinical studies or clinical research, the proposed interventions are found to be toxic or induce unwelcome side effects, are mooted by more successful ideas, or, most often, simply fail to work as hoped.
- Each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic. Therefore, by multiplying the probabilities of success, the claim that all of these proposals can be accomplished, although presented with confidence in de Grey's writings, seems nonsensical.
- Consequently, the idea that a research programme organized around the SENS agenda will not only retard ageing, but also reverse it—creating young people from old ones—and do so within our lifetime, is so far from plausible that it commands no respect at all within the informed scientific community.

- "Their knowledge of SENS is woeful."
