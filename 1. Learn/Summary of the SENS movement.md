# Short summary of the SENS movement's rationale (for newcomers)
1. *All* age-related health problems are a result of wear-and-tear damage that accumulates within the body over the course of our lives, just as the aging of any man-made machine--such as a car--is the result of the accumulation of wear-and-tear damage.
1. We have strong reason to believe that we know *all* of the different kinds of age-related damage there are, and they fall into just seven categories (the problems in each category being similarly treatable).
1. But because scientists have been thinking about the problem the wrong way, current research into fighting age-related diseases is aiming to either "cure" the damage as if it was an infectious disease, or stop the damage from happening in the first place (analogous to trying to modify a car to never accumulate wear-and-tear), rather than aiming to repair the damage (analogous to "routine preventative maintenance").
1. If we can get people to fund the right (repair-focused) research, we have a "50% chance" (Aubrey's estimate) of being able to add 30 years of healthy life to currently-middle-aged adults.
1. If we can achieve that first 30 years, we have a *very* good chance of being able to "continue to kick the can down the road" as follow-on breakthroughs allow us to repair whatever damage was not handled by first-generation therapies.
