#### How to contribute to the summary
- The high-level summary basically aims to take groups of paragraphs and combine them into a more-general description of what is discussed, or if there's a main idea being built-up to or argued for, it'll list that idea.
- The low-level summary basically summarizes things at the paragraph-level, although not strictly: if two paragraphs are talking about the same main idea, they'll be combined into a single point, and if a single paragraph contains two important ideas, they'll both be listed.

# High-level summary
- Preface:
  - Aubrey emphasizes that our action or inaction has big consequences,
  - thanks his collaborators for helping to get the book written, and
  - adds a disclaimer for scientists that this book is meant for a general audience and is missing some detail that may make it seem flawed.
#### Part One
1. The Eureka Moment
    - Aubrey describes the Big Idea that inspired this book: that repairing the damage caused by metabolism would be a far easier way to fight aging than the prevailing approach of trying to modify metabolism to not create the damage in the first place.
2. Wake Up--Aging Kills!
    - Aubrey uses the number of deaths and years of debilitation caused by aging to argue that aging causes far more harm than any other source of harm,
    - he explains that he wrote the book to convince the public that it really is possible to dramatically increase lifespans within our lifetime,
    - he explains that there is a 'pro-aging trance' where otherwise-reasonable people will not discuss this topic reasonably, perhaps as a psychological defense a la "if you can't fix it, don't worry about it",
    - he explains that no reputable challenge to the SENS strategy has been put forth, despite a high-profile call for them,
    - he provides an overview of the remaining chapters,
    - he clarifies the overall prediction he is making: a 50% chance of success within 30 years given adequate funding,
    - he stresses the importance of small private donations early-on to bootstrap the strategy.

# Low-level summary

### Preface
- Aubrey emphasizes that our action or inaction has big consequences, thanks his collaborators for helping to get the book written, and adds a disclaimer for scientists that this book is meant for a general audience and is missing some detail that may make it seem flawed.
- Aubrey wrote parts One and Three (which deal with the big picture), and his collaborator Michael Rae took charge of writing Part Two, which explains each of the seven different categories of damage in detail and how each might be repaired.
## Part One
### 1. The Eureka Moment
- On June 25, 2000, Aubrey was in bed after a day at an anti-aging brainstorming workshop, thinking about how difficult it would be to end aging with the traditional biogerontological approach of attempting to understand how human metabolism works well enough to create therapies that would modify our metabolism so that it doesn't create damage.
- Biologists of aging had spent decades studying aging as "an almost hopelessly complex tragedy about which everyone could theorize and argue, but about which nothing could fundamentally be done."
- "That night, I swept aside all that complexity, revealing a new simplicity in a complete redefinition of the problem. To intervene in aging, I realized, didn't require a complete understanding of all the myriad interacting processes that *contribute to* aging damage. To design therapies, all you have to understand is aging damage *itself*: the molecular and cellular lesions that impair the structure and function of the body's tissues. Once I realized that simple truth, it became clear that we are far closer to real solutions to treating aging as a biomedical problem, amenable to therapy and healing, than it might otherwise seem."
### 2. Wake Up--Aging Kills!
- Q: How many healthy, youthful years in total do you think you could add to people's lives, in your life?
- A: The ultimate purpose of this book is to show you that you could add many more years than you may currently think.
- In this chapter I will explain the magnitude of what our efforts could achieve.
- 150,000 people die each day worldwide, two-thirds of whom die from aging.
  - Comparison: that's thirty 9/11s or sixty Hurricane Katrinas, every day.
- In the industrialized world, aging causes 90% of deaths.
  - Comparison: So for every death from homicide, AIDS, car accidents, etc., nine other people die of aging.
#### Why Did I Write This Book?
- Answer: The pro-aging trance.
- Analogy: "Virtually all adults, smokers or not, support" the idea that we ought to prevent people from taking up smoking, and yet we (as a society) continue to allow cigarettes to be advertised. There is a disconnect there.
- Analogy cont'd: The main reason so many more people disapprove of smoking now than fifty years ago is that there has been a large-scale realization by the public of its terrible health effects.
- "My goal with this book, as for all my outreach work, is to inject momentum into a similar shift of public opinion concerning aging."
#### The Motivation for the Pro-Aging Trance
- I realize there's a huge anti-aging industry that the public is supportive of, but it aims only for modest postponement of aging.
- The prospect of society eventually being able to eliminate aging as a cause of death "strikes terror into most people".
  - The usual reaction is to worry about overpopulation, or only the wealthy benefiting, or dictators living forever, etc.
- I am not saying these objections are dumb.
- What shocks me is that people more-often-than-not resist discussing the topic seriously.
  - They will change the subject.
  - They will "relegate the conversation to an exchange of witicisms".
  - They will "cast the opponent of aging as a deluded nincompoop".
- The reason people are behaving this way is that ntil recently, aging has been inveitable, which makes it smarter to just put it out of one's mind.
#### A Word About SENS Skepticism
- In this section I will briefly describe where the debate of SENS's chances of success currently stands.
- It is the norm for radical new concepts to arouse a sharp division of opinion among expert commentators.
- Very often, the detractors among these commentators never acquire a detailed understanding of what they are criticizing, instead having their criticism driven by vested interests.
- All scientists acknowledge (at least in private) that the intellectual and emotional investment that senior scientists have made in their beliefs is a powerful opponent to objectivity.
  - Physicist Max Planck observed over eighty years ago that "science advances funeral by funeral".
  - Biologist J.B.S. Haldane noted that "there are four stages of acceptance: (i) this is worthless nonsense; (ii) this is an interesting, but perverse point of view; (ii) this is true, but quite unimportant; (iv) I always said so."
- "I am extremely keen to identify any major holes in SENS so that, if they indeed exist, I can go back to the drawing board without delay".
- In 2006 the prestigious MIT Technology Review magazine posted an open challenge to my critics, offering a $20,000 reward if any could rebut my claims to the satisfaction of an impartial panel of judges. There were only two submissions, and they were both "emphatically judged to fall decisively short of a demonstration that SENS is not worth trying".
#### Building a Case, Chapter by Chapter
- In Chapter 3 I will describe:
  - why aging can in principle be eliminated just as with any other disease, and 
  - how most biologists of aging have been looking at the problem the wrong way, which is unlikely to work.
- In Chapter 4 I will provide an overview of the SENS strategy for defeating aging within a few decades.
- Part 2 elaborates on the individual components of that strategy.
- Part 3 covers:
  - my prediction of how society will respond to initial successes in the laboratory a decade or so from now,
  - how our therapies will be improved over the next few decades to keep aging at bay, and
  - how you can help.
- I predict that if we have enough funding, we have a 50% chance of succeeding within 25 to 30 years.
  - Full text: "I consider that if funding is sufficient we have a 50/50 chance of developing technology within about twenty-five to thirty years from now that will, under reasonable assumptions about the rate of subsequent improvements in that technology, allow us to stop people dying of aging at any age--equivalent to the effect of today's antiretrovirals against HIV."
- There are three big caveats to that prediction:
  - It's only a 50% chance.
  - This won't be a total defeat of aging; just enough to buy us enough time to keep 'kicking the can down the road' with further improvements.
  - This assumes funding for this effort is increased such that the research that *can* be done *is* done.
- Small amounts of money will be "pivotal" early-on to fund the relatively-less-expensive mouse research that will get society excited enough to supply the necessary larger amount funding into the effort.
- This book focuses on convincing readers of the *practicality* of radical life extension; if you want answers to questions about the *desirability* of life extension, check my website.
