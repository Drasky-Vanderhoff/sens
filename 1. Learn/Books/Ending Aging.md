# Summary

### Preface
- Aubrey wrote parts One and Three (which deal with the big picture), and his collaborator Michael Rae took charge of writing Part Two, which explains each of the seven different cateogires of damage in detail and how each might be repaired.
## Part One
### 1. The Eureka Moment
- On June 25, 2000, Aubrey was in bed after a day at an anti-aging brainstorming workshop, thinking about how difficult it would be to end aging with the traditional biogerontological approach of attempting to understand how human metabolism works well enough to create therapies that would modify our metabolism so that it doesn't create damage.
- Biologists of aging had spent decades studying aging as "an almost hopelessly complex tragedy about which everyone could theorize and argue, but about which nothing could fundamentally be done."
- "That night, I swept aside all that complexity, revealing a new simplicity in a complete redefinition of the problem. To intervene in aging, I realized, didn't require a complete understanding of all the myriad interacting processes that *contribute to* aging damage. To design therapies, all you have to understand is aging damage *itself*: the molecular and cellular lesions that impair the structure and function of the body's tissues. Once I realized that simple truth, it became clear that we are far closer to real solutions to treating aging as a biomedical problem, amenable to therapy and healing, than it might otherwise seem."
### 2. Wake Up--Aging Kills!
- Q: How many healthy, youthful years in total do you think you could add to people's lives, in your life?
- A: The ultimate purpose of this book is to show you that you could add many more years than you may currently think.
- In this chapter I will explain the magnitude of what our efforts could achieve.
- 150,000 people die each day worldwide, two-thirds of whom die from aging.
  - Comparison: that's thirty 9/11s or sixty Hurricane Katrinas, every day.
- In the industrialized world, aging causes 90% of deaths.
  - Comparison: So for every death from homicide, AIDS, car accidents, etc., nine other people die of aging.
#### Why Did I Write This Book?
- Answer: The pro-aging trance.
- Analogy: "Virtually all adults, smokers or not, support" the idea that we ought to prevent people from taking up smoking, and yet we (as a society) continue to allow cigarettes to be advertised. There is a disconnect there.
- Analogy cont'd: The main reason so many more people disapprove of smoking now than fifty years ago is that there has been a large-scale realization by the public of its terrible health effects.
- "My goal with this book, as for all my outreach work, is to inject momentum into a similar shift of public opinion concerning aging."
