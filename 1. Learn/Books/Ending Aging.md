#### How to contribute to the summary
- The high-level summary should try to boil each chapter down to a single sentence relaying its most important idea. I would prefer that this be based on the mid-level summary.
- The mid-level summary basically aims to take groups of paragraphs and combine them into a more-general description of what is discussed, or if there's a main idea being built-up to or argued for, it'll list that idea. I would prefer that this be based on the low-level summary.
- The low-level summary basically summarizes things at the paragraph-level, although not strictly: if two paragraphs are talking about the same main idea, they'll be combined into a single point, and if a single paragraph contains two important ideas, they'll both be listed. I would prefer that this be the first summary worked on for each chapter, so that the high- and mid-level summaries are more accurate.

# High-level summary
- Preface:
  - We all need to act now.
#### Part One
1. The Eureka Moment
    - The Big Idea that inspired this book (and the SENS movement more generally) is that *repairing* the damage caused by metabolism would be a far easier way to stop aging than the prevailing approach of trying to modify metabolism to *not create* the damage in the first place.
2. Wake Up--Aging Kills!
    - Aging is the worst problem in the world, and because up until now there's been nothing we could do about it, people default to a "pro-aging trance", which makes it harder to get them to help find a final cure now that we're in a position to do so.
3. Demystifying Aging
4. Engineering Rejuvenation

8. Cutting Free of the Cellular Spider Webs

11. New Cells for Old
12. Nuclear Mutations and the Total Defeat Of Cancer
#### Part Three
13. Getting from Here to There: The War on Aging
14. Bootstrapping Our Way to an Ageless Future
    - Our initial therapies will only be able to extend life by thirty to fifty years, but that should be enough time to develop further therapies to buy ourselves more time, and if we can keep doing that (which I suspect we can), we will have achieved "longevity escape velocity" (LEV).
15. War Bonds for the Campaign Against Aging
    - The best way for you to hasten the arrival of comprehensive anti-aging therapies is to donate to the Methuselah Foundation, which funds the needed research directly as well as the Methuselah Mouse Prize, which should attract even more funding.


# Mid-level summary
- Preface:
  - Aubrey emphasizes that our action or inaction has big consequences,
  - thanks his collaborators for helping to get the book written, and
  - adds a disclaimer for scientists that this book is meant for a general audience and is missing some detail that may make it seem flawed.
#### Part One

    - Aubrey describes the Big Idea that inspired this book: that repairing the damage caused by metabolism would be a far easier way to stop aging than the prevailing approach of trying to modify metabolism to not create the damage in the first place.
2. Wake Up--Aging Kills!
    - Aubrey uses the number of deaths and years of debilitation caused by aging to argue that aging causes far more harm than any other source of harm,
    - he explains that he wrote the book to convince the public that it really is possible to dramatically increase lifespans within our lifetime,
    - he explains that there is a 'pro-aging trance' where otherwise-reasonable people will not discuss this topic reasonably, perhaps as a psychological defense a la "if you can't fix it, don't worry about it",
    - he explains that no reputable challenge to the SENS strategy has been put forth, despite a high-profile call for them,
    - he provides an overview of the remaining chapters,
    - he clarifies the overall prediction he is making: a 50% chance of success within 30 years given adequate funding,
    - he stresses the importance of small private donations early-on to bootstrap the strategy.

# Low-level summary

### Preface
- Aubrey emphasizes that our action or inaction has big consequences, thanks his collaborators for helping to get the book written, and adds a disclaimer for scientists that this book is meant for a general audience and is missing some detail that may make it seem flawed.
- Aubrey wrote parts One and Three (which deal with the big picture), and his collaborator Michael Rae took charge of writing Part Two, which explains each of the seven different categories of damage in detail and how each might be repaired.
## Part One
### 1. The Eureka Moment (5pp)
- On June 25, 2000, Aubrey was in bed after a day at an anti-aging brainstorming workshop, thinking about how difficult it would be to end aging with the traditional biogerontological approach of attempting to understand how human metabolism works well enough to create therapies that would modify our metabolism so that it doesn't create damage.
- Biologists of aging had spent decades studying aging as "an almost hopelessly complex tragedy about which everyone could theorize and argue, but about which nothing could fundamentally be done."
- "That night, I swept aside all that complexity, revealing a new simplicity in a complete redefinition of the problem. To intervene in aging, I realized, didn't require a complete understanding of all the myriad interacting processes that *contribute to* aging damage. To design therapies, all you have to understand is aging damage *itself*: the molecular and cellular lesions that impair the structure and function of the body's tissues. Once I realized that simple truth, it became clear that we are far closer to real solutions to treating aging as a biomedical problem, amenable to therapy and healing, than it might otherwise seem."
### 2. Wake Up--Aging Kills! (11pp)
- Q: How many healthy, youthful years in total do you think you could add to people's lives, in your life?
- A: The ultimate purpose of this book is to show you that you could add many more years than you may currently think.
- In this chapter I will explain the magnitude of what our efforts could achieve.
- 150,000 people die each day worldwide, two-thirds of whom die from aging.
  - Comparison: that's thirty 9/11s or sixty Hurricane Katrinas, every day.
- In the industrialized world, aging causes 90% of deaths.
  - Comparison: So for every death from homicide, AIDS, car accidents, etc., nine other people die of aging.
#### Why Did I Write This Book?
- Answer: To break people out of the pro-aging trance.
- Analogy: "Virtually all adults, smokers or not, support" the idea that we ought to prevent people from taking up smoking, and yet we (as a society) continue to allow cigarettes to be advertised. There is a disconnect there.
- Analogy cont'd: The main reason so many more people disapprove of smoking now than fifty years ago is that there has been a large-scale realization by the public of its terrible health effects.
- "My goal with this book, as for all my outreach work, is to inject momentum into a similar shift of public opinion concerning aging."
#### The Motivation for the Pro-Aging Trance
- I realize there's a huge anti-aging industry that the public is supportive of, but it aims only for modest postponement of aging.
- The prospect of society eventually being able to eliminate aging as a cause of death "strikes terror into most people".
  - The usual reaction is to worry about overpopulation, or only the wealthy benefiting, or dictators living forever, etc.
- I am not saying these objections are dumb.
- What shocks me is that people more-often-than-not resist discussing the topic seriously.
  - They will change the subject.
  - They will "relegate the conversation to an exchange of witicisms".
  - They will "cast the opponent of aging as a deluded nincompoop".
- The reason people are behaving this way is that ntil recently, aging has been inveitable, which makes it smarter to just put it out of one's mind.
#### A Word About SENS Skepticism
- In this section I will briefly describe where the debate of SENS's chances of success currently stands.
- It is the norm for radical new concepts to arouse a sharp division of opinion among expert commentators.
- Very often, the detractors among these commentators never acquire a detailed understanding of what they are criticizing, instead having their criticism driven by vested interests.
- All scientists acknowledge (at least in private) that the intellectual and emotional investment that senior scientists have made in their beliefs is a powerful opponent to objectivity.
  - Physicist Max Planck observed over eighty years ago that "science advances funeral by funeral".
  - Biologist J.B.S. Haldane noted that "there are four stages of acceptance: (i) this is worthless nonsense; (ii) this is an interesting, but perverse point of view; (ii) this is true, but quite unimportant; (iv) I always said so."
- "I am extremely keen to identify any major holes in SENS so that, if they indeed exist, I can go back to the drawing board without delay".
- In 2006 the prestigious MIT Technology Review magazine posted an open challenge to my critics, offering a $20,000 reward if any could rebut my claims to the satisfaction of an impartial panel of judges. There were only two submissions, and they were both "emphatically judged to fall decisively short of a demonstration that SENS is not worth trying".
#### Building a Case, Chapter by Chapter
- In Chapter 3 I will describe:
  - why aging can in principle be eliminated just as with any other disease, and 
  - how most biologists of aging have been looking at the problem the wrong way, which is unlikely to work.
- In Chapter 4 I will provide an overview of the SENS strategy for defeating aging within a few decades.
- Part 2 elaborates on the individual components of that strategy.
- Part 3 covers:
  - my prediction of how society will respond to initial successes in the laboratory a decade or so from now,
  - how our therapies will be improved over the next few decades to keep aging at bay, and
  - how you can help.
- I predict that if we have enough funding, we have a 50% chance of succeeding within 25 to 30 years.
  - Full text: "I consider that if funding is sufficient we have a 50/50 chance of developing technology within about twenty-five to thirty years from now that will, under reasonable assumptions about the rate of subsequent improvements in that technology, allow us to stop people dying of aging at any age--equivalent to the effect of today's antiretrovirals against HIV."
- There are three big caveats to that prediction:
  - It's only a 50% chance.
  - This won't be a total defeat of aging; just enough to buy us enough time to keep 'kicking the can down the road' with further improvements.
  - This assumes funding for this effort is increased such that the research that *can* be done *is* done.
- Small amounts of money will be "pivotal" early-on to fund the relatively-less-expensive mouse research that will get society excited enough to supply the necessary larger amount funding into the effort.
- This book focuses on convincing readers of the *practicality* of radical life extension; if you want answers to questions about the *desirability* of life extension, check my website.
### 3. Demystifying Aging (20pp)
- There will be a subset of readers trapped in the pro-aging trance who--"in their heart of hearts"--believe that aging may someday come under medical control, but they also subconsciously(?) believe the odds of it happening within their lifetime are so low (0%-1%) that it's psychologically more comfortable to *irrationally* believe that aging will *never* come under medical control.
- My goals in this chapter are to:
  1. dismantle that safe-haven of being able to believe that aging will *never* come under medical control, and
  1. demonstrate further that the odds of aging being brought under control *in the foreseeable future* are *at least* non-zero.
- To that end I am going to debunk the popular idea that aging is a phenomenon unlike all other health conditions.
#### The Illusory Boundary Between Aging and Disease
- Through the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, while gerontology was making its big push for recognition as a legitimate biological discipline, rhetoric developed to the effect that the infirmities of aging should be viewed as separable into two distinct phenomena: on the one hand, age-related diseases, and on the other hand, "aging itself".
- Gerontologists did this to try to protect funding for their field (which was to study those things they described as "aging itself").
- The truth is, "All gerontologists know that aging is no more and no less than the *collective early stages* of the various age-related diseases."
- "I maintain that it is overwhelmingly the inaccurate rhetoric of gerontologists, resulting from their misguided policy of previous decades, that has brought about such entrenched resistance to a simple, obvious and (within the field) universally agreed-upon truth about the potential value of postponing aging."

- The initial therapies will not be perfect.
  - There will still be a gradual ("residual") accumulation of damage.
  - This will probably lead to death from aging being delayed only thirty to fifty years.
- In this chapter I'm going to explain why that initial 30-50 years will be enough for us to continue making advances such that "I expect many people alive today to live to one thousand years of age".
#### Evolution Didn't Leave Notes
- The fact that the body is a machine just like a car sounds like reason to suppose that the initial therapies will be perfect.
- But unlike man-made machines, "we are still profoundly ignorant of the details" of metabolism.
- Thus, "as we fix more and more aspects of aging, you can bet that new aspects will be unmasked."
- We need to worry about entirely new categories of damage as well as less-common variations of the existing seven categories.
- Therapies that rejuvenate sixty-year-olds will not work so well the second time around, because the "more-difficult" / untreated forms of damage will have continued to accumulate.
- "Even though it will be much harder to double a middle-aged human's remaining life span than a middle-aged mouse's, multiplying that remaining lifespan by much larger factors--ten or thirty, say--will be much *easier* in humans than in mice."
#### The Two-Speed Pace of Technology
- For centuries humans have been interested in flying, but "no success in this area was achieved until about a century ago".
- Ever since Kitty Hawk, though, "aviation engineers seem to have progressed at an almost serenely smooth pace".
- This pattern of fundamental breakthroughs followed by incremental refinements is typical of the history of technological fields.
- Thus, I suspect we will see something similar with life extension therapies.
- A mouse's lifespan is so short that the mice that receive first-generation therapies will not live long enough to receive the benefit of second-generation therapies.
- But the first *humans* to receive those first-generation therapies will have *twenty* years to find those second-generation therapies.
#### Longevity Escape Velocity
- Thus there exists some rate of progress that will allow us to "stave off aging indefinitely".
- I think the term "longevity escape velocity" (LEV) sums that up pretty well.
- One thing to note is that we can "accumulate lead time" in one period that we can use in a later more-slowly-advancing period.
- Another way to describe LEV is that we need to keep the overall level of damage in the body to a level that the body can work around.
- LEV analogy: If normal life is like jumping off a cliff (where gravity is aging and touching the ground is death), and these therapies are like a jetpack, LEV is when you are on average not moving downward.
#### The Political and Social Significance of Discussing LEV
- Scientists have responded to my LEV concept with "blank incomprehension".
- One reason is that the idea is "distant from the sort of thinking that they normally do".
- Senior gerontologists don't want to be "seen as having anything to do with radical life extension, with all the uncertainties it will surely herald".
- I won't avoid talking about LEV because it's important for people to understand what's at stake.
- Billionaires are becoming more willing to contribute to world health projects.
- SENS must be able to justify itself on the same humanitarian terms as traditional world health projects despite initially primarily benefiting the wealthy.
- The LEV concept is crucial to make clear the eventual full impact of the initial expenditures and thereby tip the philanthropists' scales in SENS's favor.
#### Quantifying Longevity Escape Velocity More Precisely
- I am working with programmer Chris Phoenix to publish precise predictions of the degree of healthy life extension we can expect given different rates of progress.
- Starting out, we need to halve the amount of damage that cannot be repaired about every forty years, and it gets easier from there.
### 15. War Bonds for the Campaign Against Aging (6pp)
- If SENS works, you have a strong chance of not dying from aging.
- How soon SENS works depends on when the funding really gets serious, which depends on when robust mouse rejuvenation happens.
- "The key question for each of us is, 'What am I going to do about it?'"
- First, take care of your health in the usual ways (diet and exercise).
- Second, "hasten the day when the battle is well and truly joined."
  - Lobby for more funding for rejuvenation research,
  - Lobby for lifting restrictions on federal funding to embryonic stem cell research in the U.S.
  - Donate to the Methuselah Foundation.
- Recap of the reason private donations are so important:
  - The reason this research isn't being funded by governments is "a mutually-reinforcing ring of poltically directed funding restrictions, scientific over-caution in public statements and grant requests, and public opinion".
  - TODO: Continue this.
