# Summary

## Part One

### 1. The Eureka Moment
- On June 25, 2000, Aubrey was in bed after a day at an anti-aging brainstorming workshop, thinking about how difficult it would be to end aging with the traditional biogerontological approach of attempting to understand how human metabolism works well enough to create therapies that would modify our metabolism so that it doesn't create damage.
- Biologists of aging had spent decades studying aging as "an almost hopelessly complex tragedy about which everyone could theorize and argue, but about which nothing could fundamentally be done."
- "That night, I swept aside all that complexity, revealing a new simplicity in a complete redefinition of the problem. To intervene in aging, I realized, didn't require a complete understanding of all the myriad interacting processes that *contribute to* aging damage. To design therapies, all you have to understand is aging damage *itself*: the molecular and cellular lesions that impair the structure and function of the body's tissues. Once I realized that simple truth, it became clear that we are far closer to real solutions to treating aging as a biomedical problem, amenable to therapy and healing, than it might otherwise seem."
