The idea here is to gather information about other groups (like Calico) or individuals (like Ray Kurzweil), with the expectation that it will in some way be useful.

For example, one way it could be useful is for understanding the situations / positions of these other groups and using that information to try to influence which research they decide to allocate money to.

    > Aubrey: He's not associated with SRF, but he and I are good friends. He's an excellent (and sometimes much-maligned) scientist. I am personally pessimistic that any approach based on mimicking calorie restriction will postpone aging much in humans, but I'll be delighted if he proves me wrong - and even if it only gives a small benefit, that'll still help some people survive long enough for SENS who otherwise wouldn't have.

  Moderator: What response have both of you had to the entrance of Calico, the Google company, and Human Longevity, Craig Venter's new company?
  
  Aubrey: It's a complicated question. I'll talk about Human Longevity first. **In my opinion they are not really working on what we're working on. They are working on personalized medicine, trying to optimize therapies that essentially already exist using analysis of large amounts of genetic data.**
  
  Moderator: So a similar company to other companies that are out there, with a fancier name?
  
  Aubrey: I would say that definitely **their hearts are in the right place**, but they are a regular, perfectly normal company. **They want to make profits fairly soon.**
