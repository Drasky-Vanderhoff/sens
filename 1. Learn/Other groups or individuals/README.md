The idea here is to gather information about other groups (like Calico) or individuals (like Ray Kurzweil), with the expectation that it will in some way be useful.

For example, one way it could be useful is for understanding the situations / positions of these other groups and using that information to try to influence which research they decide to allocate money to.

  - > SebastianPye: What do you think of David Sinclairs work? Is he associated with SENS?
    >
    > Aubrey: He's not associated with SRF, but he and I are good friends. He's an excellent (and sometimes much-maligned) scientist. I am personally pessimistic that any approach based on mimicking calorie restriction will postpone aging much in humans, but I'll be delighted if he proves me wrong - and even if it only gives a small benefit, that'll still help some people survive long enough for SENS who otherwise wouldn't have.

  Moderator: What response have both of you had to the entrance of Calico, the Google company, and Human Longevity, Craig Venter's new company?
  
  Aubrey: It's a complicated question. I'll talk about Human Longevity first. **In my opinion they are not really working on what we're working on. They are working on personalized medicine, trying to optimize therapies that essentially already exist using analysis of large amounts of genetic data.**
  
  Moderator: So a similar company to other companies that are out there, with a fancier name?
  
  Aubrey: I would say that definitely **their hearts are in the right place**, but they are a regular, perfectly normal company. **They want to make profits fairly soon.**

  - > kenbolland: Thank you for this, Dr de Grey. While it is unquestionable that damage accumulation will have grave consequences, is it certain that this is the proximal cause of aging? I.e., might this have serious consequences not when we are 75 but 150? Hyperfunction theory (Blagosklonny and others) holds that aging is caused primarily by continued activation of ancient signal transduction pathways evolved for growth and reproduction, long after the period of reproduction has passed.
    >
    > Aubrey: Blag's theory is very fashionable right now, but please note that it is not actually in conflict with SENS. There's really no such thing as the "damage theory", because I simply define damage to be the progressive changes in the body's structure that eventually sicken and kill us. If those changes are brought about by inappropriately continued gene expression, so what? - they can still be reversed (repaired).

  - > florianist: Hi Aubrey & Haroldo, there has been articles in some newspapers about several new methods of treating cancer (called immunotherapies) that increase the strength of immune responses against cancer tumors. In general, how do you see the potential of immunotherapies in the fight against cancer? In particular, is there something in the development of those therapies that can also help SENS?
    >
    > Aubrey: Very exciting. There are many new approaches to this. Especially check out a new company named Ntercept that is going beyond stimulating the immune system - their approach is to weaken the cancer's defence against the immune system.
