# A short summary of the SENS movement's rationale
1. *All* age-related health problems are a result of wear-and-tear damage that accumulates within the body over the course of our lives, just as the aging of any man-made machine--such as a car--is the result of the accumulation of wear-and-tear damage.
1. But because scientists have been thinking about aging in two other (and wrong) ways, current research into fighting age-related diseases is aiming to either intervene too late (analogous to trying to repair a car that has been neglected for decades), or stop the damage from happening in the first place (analogous to trying to modify a car to never accumulate wear-and-tear), rather than the correct approach of periodically repairing the damage before it gets out-of-hand (analogous to "routine preventative maintenance").
1. We have strong reason to believe that we know *all* of the different kinds of age-related damage there are, and they fall into just seven categories (with the variations of damage in each category being similarly-treatable).
1. We have strong reason to believe that we can develop treatments for all seven categories of damage in our lifetime. If we can get people to fund the right research, we have a "50% chance" (Aubrey's estimate) of being able to add 30 years of healthy life to currently-middle-aged adults.
1. If we can achieve that first 30 years, we have a *very* good chance of being able to "continue to kick the can down the road" as follow-on breakthroughs allow us to repair whatever damage was not handled by first-generation therapies.
