#### [2016.09.09 - Reddit - Futurology - Aubrey de Grey & Matthew O'Connor AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/51wpds/aubrey_de_grey_matthew_oconnor_ama/)

I am Dr. Aubrey De Grey, biologist, gerontologist PhD and author of the book Ending Aging and Chief Science Officer at the **SENS Research Foundation**. I am here with researcher Dr. Matthew O'Connor from the **MitoSENS** project who is an expert on "allotopic expression" of mitochondrial genes. His team has been working on engineering mitochondrial genes to be expressed from the nucleus and targeted to the mitochondia as part of the MitoSENS approach to one of the damages of aging.

*Each cell in the body is dependent on the efficient generation of cellular energy by mitochondria to stay alive. Critical to this process are genes encoded within the mitochondrial genome. Over time however, mutations in these genes occur as a result of constant exposure to reactive oxygen species produced by oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial energy generation process. Unlike genes within the nucleus, mitochondria lack an efficient system to repair damaged DNA. This leads to accumulated mutations, resulting in mitochondrial defects and an increase in oxidative stress throughout the body. Closely correlated with this is the observation that organisms which age more slowly also consistently display lower rates of mitochondrial free radical damage. Thus, reversing and/or preventing damage to mitochondrial DNA may be a key factor in slowing the aging process.*

The SENS Research Foundation recently published very positive data the result of a community fundraiser at **[Lifespan.io](https://www.lifespan.io/)** showing that the MitoSENS approach is viable. If you would like to read our published paper you can do so **[here](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/04/nar.gkw756)**.

This research is a huge step forward for aging research and our understanding of aging and the approaches we can apply to it. If you would like to learn more about the SENS Research Foundation please visit **[www.sens.org](http://www.sens.org/)**

Q: CRISPR gene editing has quickly become the breakthrough technology of the year, accurate and powerful, implemented in science labs all over the world.

Wouldn't it be the most straightforward solution to simply edit out the genes responsible for genetic diseases and insert in the genes associated with extreme health and longevity, and almost immunity to cancer, as those living in the blue zones have?

Aubrey de Grey: Short answer: no, both because there are innumerably many such genes and because the differences between different gene variants only modestly alter the rate of damage creation. Longevity in the blue zones is only a few years better than elsewhere.

Q: How long do you think it will take before we can reverse surface level aging : hair loss, gray hair & wrinkles? Which of the 7 damages types do we need to solve to make it happen?

Aubrey de Grey: Wrinkles are mainly from crosslinking, an area that was pretty much stalled for 20 years until our breakthrough publication in Science last October; still a way to go but we're now making rapid progress. Hair loss and grey hair are mostly a cell loss problem, and rejuvenating the epidermal stem cell population (as well as melanocytes specifically) is something a lot of people are making good progress on; check out the work of Elaine Fuchs and Fiona Watt and Colin Jahoda especially.

Q: Hello Dr. De Grey and Dr, O'Connor, I congratulate you with great results. Thank you so much for pushing longevity science forward!

Could you please tell what will be the next stage of the MitoSENS project, are you going to try to reproduce mitochondrial gene relocation in animals?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Looks like there are several variations on this question so I'll try to tackle them here: yes we want to take this into animals next and yes we are starting now. I don't have any results to share yet but we are in the very earliest stages of pre-mouse work now. We are working in mouse cells to make sure that we can get our process working in cells before we move into whole mice.

Q: Hi Dr. De Grey and Dr. O'connor. Are you guys considering or taking advantage of the power of deep learning to accelerate your research into aging?

Aubrey de Grey: We are definitely interested in this. Alex Zhavoronkov, one of our foremost associates, now runs a company named Insilico Medicine which is spearheading that approach. Also, Demis Hassabis (head of Deepmind) and I have been friends for 20 years (since he was an undergraduate at Cambridge).

Q: I read *Ending Aging* about 5 years ago. What progress has been made toward Robust Mouse Rejuvenation (RMR) since then? Is there progress that has been contributed by Dr. O'Connor's work?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: There was a cool paper published - i think in science last year, that revealed more of the mechanism of co-translational import of mito genes that we are also studying to try to improve our targeting/import.

Q: How can grassroots activism most effectively be leveraged to hasten the defeat of aging?

Aubrey de Grey: The key thing is to tackle both feasibility and desirability together, which paradoxically means tackling them separately. People are scared to get their hopes up, and they dismiss the feasibility issue because they have already decided that success would be a bad idea, and at the same time they dismiss the desirability issue because they have already decided that the whole concept is a pipe dream. So, first force your interlocutor into understanding that that linkage is logically absurd and thus into addressing the two questions separately. Then, give them the best arguments; you can get those from my voluminous output.

Q: I would like to ask Oki, now we have great results how long do you think it will be before we can do the same with the other 11 genes and are these genes technically any more or less challenging than the two already done?

Great progress so far so what is the next step in terms of development moving towards the clinic?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Great question. Yes, there is reason to believe that some of the other 11 will be harder than ATP8 and ATP6. In fact, ATP6 is itself much harder than ATP8 and our results with that aren't as strong as with ATP8. We have some technologies that we've tested already that seem to work a bit with the harder genes and we're layering on additional levels of mitochondrial targeting and import. The hard thing is how complicated it gets when we start combining multiple targeting strategies together and quantifying their affects. We are building a rigorous system so that we can test variables in a matrix and clearly determine what works and what doesn't.

Q: Ok, I'm going to throw a bit of a curveball. Your technology seems to be able to deal with mutations that are full deletions of mitochondrial DNA genes, but what about mitochondrial diseases that are caused by point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA? Won't these misfolded proteins still being produced compete with the corrected proteins now being produced by your imported RNA?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: This is a hard question. We don't really know how effectively our engineered genes will compete with existing mutant (or non-mutant for that matter) proteins. We and others have done some work on it, but the answers aren't satisfying for me yet. We are at the conceptual stages of designing a rigorous method of quantifying this. Not clear that mutant proteins much exist in "normal" aging though, so it might be a non-issue for aging but a very important question for inherited mito disease.

Aubrey de Grey: Augmenting what Oki said: recently a new mouse model has been developed that accumulates deletions at an accelerated rate. It is a "binary system" that allows the problem to be activated in a tissue-specific manner by crossing with specific other mice, so it's very versatile. I expect that it will be quite useful.

The point mutation mice are not all that paradoxical really, because they tend to accumulate mutations in stem cells (in the gut etc) and the effect on tissue function may be pretty mild jut because those cells don't need much OXPHOS.

Q: Hello Dr. De Grey, Love your work!

From what I understand you used to be an engineer working on A.I research before you self taught yourself biology and became a gerontologist.

so my question is, If someone wanted to follow in your footsteps and fight aging. What would they need to do to self learn biology? assuming that for various reasons they cant learn it officially in a university.

Aubrey de Grey: I never advise people to try to follow my career path, because it involved such an insane amount of sheer unadulterated luck that there is no way anyone could. The right way to think about this is the same as with regard to learning a skill: it's not the facts you learn that matter, so much as the ability to learn new facts quickly and efficiently later on. Similarly here, the right thing is to look hard at your own circumstances and options and consider how they most promisingly lead to a place you want to reach. The best route for you will almost certainly not resemble the route that I or anyone else you might pick took.

Q: Thank you for doing this AMA, Aubrey de Grey & Matthew O'Connor!

1) Do you think we will see major steps and results in mice in the next 5 years?

2) Do you expect to see a generation 1 therapies within 30 years?

3) what's your thoughts on Mind Uploading?

4) Ray Kurzweil have made some confident predictions. He believes we only 10-12 years to reach Longevity Escape Velocity. Do you agree with him or Is his prediction too optimistic?

Aubrey de Grey: 1) Yes, there's a chance of that; I'd say in 6-8 years there's at least a 50% chance. And by "major" I mean RMR, i.e. seriously life-extending interventions that start in middle age.

2) Yes - my current 50% prediction is 20-25 years.

3) I don't think about it much.

4) A factor of two difference in technological timeframe predictions is not much of a disagreement!

I would add that we might see human gene therapies in patients with mitochondria disease in much shorter periods of time. If these work the chances of it working on aging increase dramatically!

Q: Where would be the best place to start to get into longevity? That is, what should one read up on, and what can one do now to increase ones healthy long life?

Aubrey de Grey: Read all the introductory material at sens.org Then read Ending Aging Then read the research papers we highlight at sens.org (our own and also those of other labs)

Q: Is it ever too late to start studying microbiology? What are some things an aspiring longevity researcher should take into account before dedicating themselves to such a cause?

Aubrey de Grey: No, never too late - whether microbiology, molecular biology or any other biology. The main thing to take into account when starting out is that you shouldn't specialise too soon, because aging affects the body at every level of organisation, hence to have the best insighhts you need a god grounding in every area of biology.

Q: Robert K. Naviaux, mitochondrial expert, asserts that their dual (or even primary) function is as an exquisitely sensitive alarm system, triggering the '[cell danger response](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567724913002390)' (CDR) to chemical or microbial threats. Also, that oxidative stress is a misguided target for therapies, in many chronic diseases, as it is more like a protective '[oxidative shielding](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/342/3/608.long)' response (to an underlying problem).

(1) How does this sit with the understanding so far in the MitoSENS project? Complement, contradict, unknown? I'm certainly no expert, and negating mitochondrial DNA damage sounds like a definite win, but could allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins truncate the CDR detrimentally? Or conversely might this innate immune functionality trip up your efforts?

I ask this as a person with chronic fatigue (CFS), since Naviaux just published [a promising metabolomics study](http://m.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/24/1607571113.full) which seems like a turning point in understanding our neglected disease. They found common indicators in subjects characteristic of hypometabolism that he describes as most similar to a 'dauer' state (which, in worms, greatly increases longevity at great cost to function, to survive extreme environmental stresses). Being stuck in a protective hypometabolic state would seem to fit well with the known reduction in our cellular energy (ATP) production, often increased oxidative stress and other idiosyncrasies, since [no causative mitochondrial mutations have been found - mutations only corresponding with symptom variety](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-0771-6). Manifesting as heterogeneous problems, like our many varied initial triggers, but perhaps a homogeneous mechanism.

(2) At a reach, does any of your work give any insight on turning off CDR states, [apparently active in developing autism](http://naviauxlab.ucsd.edu/science-item/autism-research/), ADHD, Alzheimer's, etc, or escaping our CFS hypometabolism?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Reading this quickly I'm going to give a snap reply that our mitoSENS project might not help this kind of "homeostasis" problem, if that problem isn't caused by the loss of mito encoded genes. Mitochondrial are indeed complex organelles with much cross-talk with the rest of the cell so our philosophy is always that the underlying problem needs to be addressed. If the problem is in the nuclear genes then that's what needs to be fixed. If the problem is in the lysosome - resulting in reduced mito turnover then we need to fix the lysosome rather than the mitochondria.

Aubrey de Grey: Exactly. It is often forgotten that mitochondria are constantly recycled even in non-dividing cells, and thus that the only damage they can possibly accumulate other than as a side-effect of something extramitochondrial is DNA damage, and only then if somehow mutant mtDNA is selected for. Historical aside: after Harman first suggested the role of mitochondria in aging in 1972, the only published reaction by anyone prominent was that Alex Comfort in 1976 rejected it on exactly this basis. He did not, of course, consider the bizarre possibility that mutant mtDNA could be selected for, which was only shown in 1993.

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Oxygen radicals are indeed used in cell signaling pathways so we can't just turn anti-oxidation up to 11, prevent all damage and call it a day. That's why we are building a system that can cope with damage and is amenable to continued treatments. Like aubrey's car maintenance analogy.

Q: Has Calico reached out to you and your team at all? I used to think that they would just be data focused (leveraging Google's greatest strength), but after they brought on Cynthia Kenyon, I'm not so sure. Why do you think they have not been more aggressive in the seven areas outlined in SENS?

Aubrey de Grey: We reached out to Calico very energetically when they were getting going but they basically blew us off. We are dismayed that they are not taking advantage of our expertise. Maybe they will start to do so eventually.

Q: Dr. De Grey, you've mentioned that SENS 1.0 therapies, when perfected, will add maybe around 30 years of healthy lifespan. Does that mean that it's impossible for them to work indefinitely long without needing any improvements? If so, why?

Aubrey de Grey: Yes, that's what it means. Here's an example that may explain it: crosslinking. Once we are able to break glucosepane, we'll be able to reduce crosslinking by a big factor - for sake of argument let's say 50% - but we won't be breaking any other crosslinks. Thus, eventually the total amount of crosslinking will return to old-age levels even if we blitz the glucosepane every year. So, we need to carry on with the introduction of therapies that hit the next most abundant link, and the next, etc.

Q: Will progress on mitosens be quicker now with the initial breakthrough you've made? How would this therapy be administered once as available? And how are billions of cells treated by a one off treatment?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Yes, I think our unambiguous results will make a big splash. Gene therapy. Gene therapies are designed to target many cells at a time. Billions of cells aren't really as many as they sound. The harder part is getting your gene therapy into all the nooks and crannies of organs.

Q: I want to ask about the potential for CRISPR to impact longevity research.

It would be nice if CRISPR or any other gene editing technique was able to, safely, edit the genes of a mature, living mammal rather than just cells in a petri dish. Could CRISPR potentially do this? If so, is CRISPR accurate enough? If such a gene therapy technique did exist, how would it impact longevity research and what do you think would be the most interesting applications? (adding gene repair proteins to the genome? extending telomeres? repairing mutations?)

Thanks.

Also I'd like to thank Aubrey for inspiring me to pursue a career in science with his TED talk in 2005. I am now completing my masters in chemistry and applying to PhD programs!

Aubrey de Grey: Great to hear I inspired you - thanks for mentioning that. CRISPR is getting very, very error-free now, so I am sure it will be a big tool in implementing SENS. We have developed a way to use it in combination with a bacterial virus; our method allows the insertion of lots of DNA (even up to 100kb potentially) in one go, into a defined location on the chromosome, so we would aim to do all the aspects of SENS that require new genes that way - mtDNA backups of course, but also enzymes to degrade waste products, and suicide genes to eliminate death-resistant toxic cells.

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: This is a good question. The short answer is that mito targeting CRISPR (and other similar gene editing tech) might be less valuable for aging than for congenital mito disease, but might be valuable for creating tools for us to use in our experiments

Q: I read somewhere that even if CRISPR is getting super accurate, reaching the trillions of cells in a human body is still an issue. What strategies are being developed to solve that problem and how far from a solution are we?

Aubrey de Grey: This is actually two sides of the same coin. Increased accuracy means a lower probability that a given CRISPR construct will do a bad thing, which in turn means that we can introduce more constructs (whether all at the same time or over repeated administrations) while remaining at an acceptable risk of bad things, which in turn means we can hit more cells.

Q: How old do you think the youngest person is today that will never have a chance to benefit from the coming longevity revolution?

Aubrey de Grey: I prefer to answer the converse question, how old is the oldest person who WILL benefit! I still think that person could be in their 60s, or even 70 now. Remember, though, that that will be a person who would naturally live to 110 without SENS.

Q: Now you have enjoyed two successful campaigns on Lifespan.io and it is looking like rejuvenation biotechnology is becoming more appreciated by the public, do you feel using platforms like Lifespan.io is more effective for funding/promoting individual projects than the general fundraising methods you have employed traditionally?

Would you consider running another lifespan.io campaign soon and if so what area of SENS do you think it would be?

Aubrey de Grey: We must always remember that the magnitude of the crowdfunding campaigns that we have conducted so far is only a small proportion of our existing budget, let alone our desired budget. Yes it may grow, but we're not seeing much sign of that yet. But still, every dollar surely helps! Anyone who's thinking of donating to the ALT campaign, please don't be put off by the fact that we just made our target - it's still open.

Q: Hello Dr. de Grey,

It seems recently there's been a bit more attention into anti-aging/gerentology research from mainstream research institutions. How has that affected the work you do at SENS, if at all? Further, some of this research covers topics SENS has advocated for, some of it doesn't. What kind of value, if any, do you see in the research that comes at anti-aging from different lines of thought?

Thanks!

Aubrey de Grey: It's huge that really respected people like Venter and Diamandis are in this now, as well as really respected companies like Google. It's making a lot of previously skeptical people take notice, and we are hopeful that it will soon translate into better funding - we really need that. As for variety of lines of thought, sure, the more the better: the main problem SENS had in years past in gaining general expert acceptance was that too many experts had already become wedded to particular prior ideas.

Q: Hi Aubrey, long time fan and early supporter of you here!

My questions are about the recent mitosens accomplishment.

How fast do you think you can move those other 11 mito genes to the nucleus?

What increase in health and lifespan can we expect from solving this 1 out of 7?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: 1) We are trying to build a system that is generalizable to all 13 genes. We still need a breakthrough or two before we get there. The good news is that since we have a good idea about which genes are the most difficult that we will know when we are there.

2) In short, no, we need to do them all separately. With regards Q2 and 5, maybe there will be synergistic health affects of applying more than 1, but less than 7 fundamental rejuvenations, but we won't know until we try. There is some evidence that just tampering with mitochondria can improve the health of old rodents.

Q: Back at the outset of the SENS research programs, the estimated cost to prototype allotopic expression of all 13 oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial genes in mice was ~$150M and ten years. At this point, MitoSENS has had probably something like a $10-15M investment (very fuzzy number) on the part of SRF, Gensight investors, other teams, etc, carried out over what is now getting on for ten years, and 3-and-a-bit of the 13 genes have been moved to the nucleus.

What is your current thinking on remaining costs and time now that the project is 20-25% of the way towards a prototype?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: We've spent a lot less than $10M on this project so far. Total from all groups working in the field must be much much more than $15M. I will get it working in mice for much less than $150M.

Q: Any plans to translate the research into a gene therapy for a specific inherited mitochondrial disease?

I know only one gene therapy has been approved in Europe as of earlier this year (and none in USA as far as I know feel free to correct me), so I was wondering if there's any chance this can be used as media leverage for SENS - in the future of course going from research to the clinic takes a lot of time I know.

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Well to get into the nitty gritty a little bit - there are exceedingly few patients who have been discovered to have mutations specific to ATP8 - less than 5 that I know of. ATP6 has more, but still very few. The gene therapy advancement that needs to happen is to get gene therapy tech approved that can be used outside of the eye. Then it will be easier to get these individual mito gene therapies approved.

Q: Hello Dr. De Gray and Dr. O'Connor can you tell us how do you plan to regenerate bones and degenerative changes on those. I understand that soft tissue is easier to repair what about skeleton?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: As far as I know, mito mutations aren't thought to cause problems with bone, which seems confusing since it's a slowly or non-growing tissue. Mito problems tend to be more exaggerated in slow growing tissues so it's not clear to me why this is the case - but bone tentatively seems not to be a problem we need to worry about too too much for mitos.

Q: Dear Dr. O'Connor, first off, congratulations! Successful translocation of ATP6 and ATP8 genes was a great acheivement. However, your mitoSENS paper closes with the following words of caution to the overly optimistic:

> We do not wish to claim, based purely our results, that this approach would be effective using any or all of the mitochondrially encoded proteins. We achieved the greatest success with ATP8, which is also the smallest mitochondrially encoded protein. ATP6, while much larger than ATP8, is still one of the smaller proteins normally translated inside of the mitochondria. Other groups have published results demonstrating difficulty in importing other proteins into the mitochondria (24,25). Indeed, our group has thus far failed, after many attempts, to express and import CYB into the mitochondria (data not shown). We hope, however, that with careful experimentation and additional levels of targeting (such as RNA targeting to promote co-translational import) (5,62), that this approach will someday become generalized to any of the 13 proteins of the mitochondrial genome. <http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/04/nar.gkw756.full>

If I understand correctly, the CYB protein is about 50% larger than ATP6. After your "many failed attempts", do you now have an understanding of what is preventing its import into the mitochondria, and, if so, what can be done to work around it?

Also, for the remaining 10 (or 11 if you count CYB) MT proteins, do you think we have a workable mechanism of importing them into the MT, should we succeed in incorporating their genes into the nuclear DNA?

Thanks!

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Yeah, so CYB is both bigger and thought to be more "hydrophobic" than other mito proteins. I really like working on CYB though for 2 reasons: One is that I think that once we solve CYB we will have solved all 13. The other is that CYB is the only mito encoded subunit of OxPhos complex III, which makes it a very simple system to study. We have cells that are null for CYB (similar to, but more simple than the cells that we used in the current publication) so we have a great system to test our innovations in.

Q: How do newly formed embryos avoid being born old with a high percentage of damaged mitochondria?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: There are 2 levels of natural selection at work here. 1 is that deleterious mutations can be selected against during mitochondrial replication - which occurs more frequently in rapidly dividing cells - which is the situation you have during a rapidly growing embryo. The second level is the survival of the embryo. It has been estimated that 1 in 200 people are born with >1% of their mitochondria containing "significant" mutations.

Q: Hi Drs De Grey and O'Connor. Do you think that allotopically expresing ATP6 and ATP8 could have a measurable life extension effect in mice? Or it's more probable that all 13 genes must be allotopically expresed in order to see some improvement? Would you recommend to check this now under the MMTP with only 2 genes?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: I think we would need to do all 13 to get some health affect in normal animals, but there might be some tricks we can use to get it to work on some mutant mouse models.


#### [2016.07.16 - Reddit - Futurology - Aubrey de Grey AMA! Ask about the quest to cure cancer’s root causes, increasing healthy human longevity, or anything else!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/51wpds/aubrey_de_grey_matthew_oconnor_ama/)

I am Dr. Aubrey De Grey, biologist, gerontologist PhD, author of Ending Aging. I am here with cancer researcher Dr. Haroldo Silva to talk about the newest universal cancer therapies, increasing healthy lifespans for all and all things SENS. So go ahead and ask us anything!

Q: Dr. De Grey, If you had to re-write your book Ending Aging today in the light of new discoveries, what would you add/modify?

Aubrey de Grey: Plenty to add, but splendidly little to modify. The classification of types of damage is unchanged, and so are the strategies for addressing each of them. There's been great progress towards that implementation, of course, both from our own work and from others; that would be the focus of any additions.

Q: First of all, a big thank you to Dr. De Grey and Dr. Silva for doing this AMA. You and everyone else involved with SENS are truly heroes, even if the majority of humanity doesn't recognize this yet. Here are my questions:

1) Will the human clinical trials resulting from Project|21 address all 7 categories of aging damage? If not, what is their goal?

2) You've mentioned, Dr. De Grey, in your last reddit AMA, that you expect to see robust mouse rejuvenation in 6-8 years. How does recently announced Project|21 fits into this? Wouldn't successfully achieving the goal of human trials by 2021 make robust mouse rejuvenation redundant? Or should we expect to see both things in parallel by 2021?

3) In a few of your recent lectures, you've said that in 5 or so years the subject of human rejuvenation will become mainstream and talked about by the likes of Oprah. Could you please elaborate on specific reasons for why you expect this to happen?

4) Dr. George Church has been [quite outspoken](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/achenblog/wp/2015/12/02/professor-george-church-says-he-can-reverse-the-aging-process/) about the feasibility of his work to reverse aging in humans in under 5 years. [Recently](http://www.lifeextension.com/Lpages/2016/CRISPR/index), he even said that he thinks we'll be seeing the first human trials in under 2 years. What is your opinion on this, and if it turns out to be successful how will it interfere with the work SENS does?

Aubrey de Grey:

1) No. The goal of Project|21 is to clear the path to the first genuine clinical trials in rejuvenation biotechnology. This will involve building better collaborations, better regulatory frameworks for rejuvenation clinical work, and pushing the first technologies specific to rejuvenation that are available and at a stage where early clinical work is truly feasible. We think this will involve technologies in intracellular damage repair, and technologies in senescent cell work, and other likely candidates for the first clinical work. The comprehensive solution, however, will require a larger selection of technologies and the investment and development power of more industrial partners (and the early successes of project 21 will be used to precipitate that).

2) Apples and oranges. RMR will probably require simultaneous, high-quality implementation of all the SENS strands in mice, because the omission of any one strand will probably cause tthe mice to die on schedule. Project21, on the other hand, is only about getting part-way to the equivalent stage in humans: first of all we would only be implementing a subset of the SENS therapies, and secondly we’d only be beginning the experiment (the clinical trial), whereas RMR is defined in terms of the outcome.

3) Mainly because the extent of progress in the lab will allow (or force!) mainstream gerontologists to say publicly that it's coming.

4) George is awesome, and what he's saying is absolutely in line with what we're saying. I don't think the trials that will be possible in as little as two years will be all that comprehensive, but maybe things can get started by then. For sure there is no interference.

Q: How satisfied are you with the progression of science in regards to human longevity? I remember you talking back in 2005(?) about how positive you were for the near future, 10 years on are you closer or further away from where you thought things would be?

Sorry for the vagueness of the question.

Aubrey de Grey: We're about where I thought we'd be in the context of the funding that has been available, but that's only about 1/3 as far forward from 2005 as I'd have expected to be with even 10x more funding, i.e. with on the order of 30 to 100 million per year. We reeeally need to ramp up that funding!

Q: I think we're all pretty unhappy with the very slow progress caused by underfunded science and medical research. An important question would be what we can actively do to convince our leaders to give the billions of dollars from our national budget not to neverending wars and killing people, but instead to curing aging medical and scientific research?

Aubrey de Grey: Political leaders don't lead, they follow, in order to get re-elected. So, the sequence is painfully clear: first convince the mainstream biogerontologists. Once they are on board it's easy: they convince the likes of Oprah, they convince the public, and they in turn convince the politicians.

Or we could just convince one billionaire...

Q: Hi Aubrey, you recently received a 10 million pound influx of investment, will this change the goal posts for the current sense timeline and will this be the tipping point for other people to start investing?

Also how does Liz Parrish's work impact what you are accomplishing at Sens?

Aubrey de Grey: There are a lot of strong feelings about BioViva swirling around the net at the moment, but it's really not as alarming as is being suggested. To address the various aspects of this issue:

1) Stimulating expression of telomerase and follistatin are plausible ways to derive some aspects of rejuvenation; if I were to choose two genes with which to do what Liz has done, those would be quite high on my list. Yes, the SENS strategy for addressing cancer is the opposite of stimulating telomerase, but that doesn't take away from the fact that such stimulation can have beneficial effects.

2) Gene therapy is certainly highly experimental still, so there is a definite risk to doing what Liz did. However, we must also remember that the public's attitude to medical risk is way over-conservative; for illustration, Mary Ruwart calculated that at least 50x more people die from slow approval of good drugs than from approval of bad drugs.

3) Self-administration has a long and distinguished history in biology research. Even such luminaries as Haldane used to do it.

4) The tests that have been done thus far to determine the effect of the therapy are certainly very inadequate, but I'm guessing that that is mainly because of budget limitations.

5) As far as I know, BioViva has not thus far offered this therapy (or any other) to the public for money.

Q: Has Elon Musk ever spoken with Dr. dr Grey or anyone else from SENS on matters related to radical life extension?

Aubrey de Grey: Briefly, a decade ago. I'd sure love to speak with him again.

Q: Are there any well-known people who support human longevity? Couldn't the support of people like Bill Gates or Elon Musk considerably boost funding of any projects?

Aubrey de Grey: We have support from a few celebrities, such as Steve Aoki and Edward James Olmos, but we definitely need more. Yes, any billionaire would do!

Q: What you do guys think about all this Nicotinamide Riboside business? Does it really increase NAD in humans? Will this have an impact on longevity in humans? Should I at the age of 35 spend my money on it along with pterostilbene and recreate Basis from Elysium?

Aubrey de Grey: I'm generally pessimistic about the human longevity potential for any intervention that seeks to mimic calorie restriction, i.e. to induce the same changes of gene expression that CR induces, because the best that can be expected from such an approach is what CR itself gives, and that seems to be much less in long-lived species than in short-lived ones. But there may nonetheless be good health benefits, si I'm all for this research.

Q: Dear Dr. de Grey.... thank you for your efforts and inspiration. I'm a very fit 47 year old and am recognizing age is now affecting me. I'm concerned that there will be a mad rush for volunteers or a price gauge for treatments. How can I become a volunteer? How may the average human being access early treatments? Are there medical insurance companies that are showing support? Should I store more youthful personal genetic material for later reference? Thank you for considering my questions.

Aubrey de Grey: I'm quite sure that the arrival of these therapies will be preceded by at least a decade by the widespread realisation that they are coming. During that decade, society will do whatever is necessary to ensure universal access.

Q: Is there anyway that access to life extending technologies can be extended to all through some kind of open sourcing of the methods or free use through structured licensing ?

Aubrey de Grey: First we need to develop those technologies!

Haroldo Silva: Was that needed for cell phone technologies to be as universally used as they are today? Let's worry about having the technology first then dissemination comes later.

Q: Hello Dr. De Grey, It is an honour to have the opportunity to adress to you personally. I unfortunately have nothing specific to ask, but I just wanted to let you know that even I, a high schooler who decided to pursue biology in higher level was able to appreciate the fine work you have pioneered. When I first discovered the works of SENS RF I was absolutely captivated. The way everything was presented and written was very clear and the goal very simple; to end aging. This made me do some further research on my own and give thought to the issue. Since then I've been working on a simple "article" in which I have aimed to - in a general and simple way overall - adress the possibilities of human immortality with a focus on human senescence and most of it gets its foundation from your work. I just wanted to make the most of this chance to thank you personally, for I can't even begin to imagine what else your work has inspired in others, let alone the lives it has saved.

Aubrey de Grey: Thanks for your kind words!

Q: Mr. Aubrey, the accurate CRISPR Cas9 gene editing was chosen by most scientists and science magazines the breakthrough scientific discovery of the year.

With it, any biologist can edit DNA at will, accurately and very cheaply, and replace the genes which are associated with very debilitating diseases:

<http://youtu.be/rDGZo5ZtcAs>

Will you start using it in scientific testing for cures for the degenerative diseases of aging as cancer, diabetes or Alzheimer's?

Thank you very much.

Aubrey de Grey: Definitely. We have a cool project that makes mice much more amenable to somatic gene therapy, and we made them with CRISPR.

Q: What's your take on why parabiosis seems to rejuvenate mice? Is damage cleared or what's going on? If not, why do the aged mice seem to perform better? Might it be epigenetic reprogramming? Is the success of parabiosis a (far from conclusive) argument in favor of genetic programming playing a role in aging?

Aubrey de Grey: It presumably works by a combination of restoring good things that are less abundant in old blood and removing bad things that are more abundant in old blood. What those things are is still a huge research area. Damage in the SENS sense is probably not cleared except that there may be some stimulation of stem cell division and thus restoration of cell number, though "pre-damage" may well be cleared somewhat via shifts in the kinetics of its creation and repair. There are bound to be epigenetic mediators of the effect. No, this has no bearing on the "programmed aging" concept.

Haroldo Silva: The microenvironment or niche surrounding tissue stem cells is key to how these cells will respond to injury or perform under normal conditions. Negative factors in old circulation (or lack of positive factors in old) seem to play a role here. Also exposure to younger and healthier kidneys, liver, immune system, etc help the old animals. It is a very complicated system to study and to sort out what the actual beneficial factors are at work there.

Q: Hi! Any advice to someone who (largely due to SENS influence) is going to start molecular biology BA this year? Which specializations will have the greatest significance on fighting aging, which need the brainpower the most?

Aubrey de Grey: Bioinformatics. We need to make sense of new discoveries more rapidly and connect the dots in a more productive way.

Q: You should have a webshop on the sens-site! I wouldnt mind a sens t-shirt or a sens coffee mug! Ok that was more of a statement than a question so let me add, are you planning on making a webshop?

Aubrey de Grey: We've done things like that before on a small scale, but that's all. Please email me at <aubrey@sens.org> and I will direct you to a relevant colleague.

Q: Hi Dr. Aubrey De Grey, you're a legend to most of us here, thank you for doing this.

Woody Allen, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Robert De Niro, Michael J. Fox, Angelina Jolie and other celebrities have expressed more than once their hate against aging and human death.

They would definitely join the curing aging cause, if contacted.

They would make great ambassadors for raising awareness against the supreme evils that degenerative aging and human death are.

How can we help to attract them to the Ending aging cause?

Thank you very much.

Jerri Barrett: If anyone can connect SENS Research Foundation with these celebrities directly please do so – we have tried to reach them all many times.

Aubrey de Grey: If they were as interested as they claim to be, they'd have been in touch by now. One can't contact such people directly - they have gatekeepers - but I do quite enough media that they must know of SENS Research Foundation if they actually care.

Q: A question about cancer:

Many people claim that most cancers are lifestyle related.

I sometimes find it difficult to convince these people that funding cancer research is of paramount importance as they tend to be bogged down in an 'either/or' way of thinking:

"We should put the emphasis on environmental/lifestyle/societal changes instead of spending even more money on research (...or stuffing people with even more medicines)"

So my question is: out of the ~1,700,000 cancers diagnosed every year in the US, is there a consensus on how many could be avoided with better lifestyle (not smoking, healthy diet, limited exposure to household & cosmetic chemical products, limited exposure to pollution etc.)? 10%? 50? 90?

Thanks a lot for your answer and for your great work!

Aubrey de Grey: There's a wide range of opinion; I tend to agree with Bruce Ames that lifestyle matters rather little with the exception of smoking.

Haroldo Silva: We should do our best to remove whatever is present in the environment that might contribute to cancer, no doubt. But still we can't ever remove all harmful agents 100%. For instance, how can we remove HPV from the environment? We have vaccines to help prevent HPV infections but even those are not effective against every strain. So what do we tell patients with cervical cancer? We cannot focus on just prevention or just therapy. Both should be worked on. Not sure about percentages, but if there is a change you can make to your lifestyle that decreases your chances of getting cancer by 10% then by all means do it!

Q: What are the best ways of helping SENS, besides donations and increasing awareness?

Aubrey de Grey: Awareness is really the key. Anyone can do that. Especially try to recruit people who are wealthier than you are!

Q: I am among the minority of people who have said at a every young age that I want to live a very long time, 150+, but all my friends and family all say they would never want to live that long. How do we change people's perception of growing old and make them think long term?

Aubrey de Grey: That's the wrong thing to try to convince people of. Instead, convince them that the diseases of old age are inseparable from the aspects of age-related ill-health that we don't label as diseases, so that the only way we'll ever "cure" Alzheimer's etc is by defeating the whole lot together. Then they won't be distracted by the unnerving side-effect that they might end up living a long time.

Q: ["Deathists"](http://it.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=deathism) often have a lot of misconceptions and fears about longevity.

They expect to live like "old people" or that they would just be bed-ridden and not be able to enjoy life, or even live while suffering.

Some people even think that we are talking about "immortality" and that if they get this "magic pill" or something, they won't be able to die even if they wanted to (I know, right?).

Some people think that if they live longer, they will see all thier loved ones die, ignoring the fact that their loved ones could also get the therapy and live longer.

I think the problem is that people just don't think hard enough about this issue, and just dismiss is immediately by thinking "it's just science fiction anyway, no point in thinking about it", and so they think about sci-fi scenarios, and those are often over-dramatized, scary, and things like that.

I think that if someone is reasonable enough, just having a conversation on this topic with them will make them more open about it, and eventually they'll realize that it's not as bad as they think to live a healthier life even at a later age.

Haroldo Silva: Most people still have the idea that living for a long time means misery especially in the last 5-10 years of life. That is not what we want. Our goal is to be healthy even at 80+ years on Earth.

Q: Hello Mr De Gray and Silva. First let me express my most profound admiration and gratitude for the work you are doing.

I would be very glad if you could comment on these remarks: I agree with the SENS approach as the only way for the ones currently alive to achieve the longevity escape velocity to remain alive long enough till the real way to stop aging is discovered. However I disagree with the general concept of damage being the cause of aging. I think we have lots of well studied examples in nature of how plastic longevity is and that any species already has most of the cellular repair mechanisms needed to keep the body alive for a much longer amount of time than the ordinary life span. Only if these mechanisms are deactivated by some epigenetic program regulated by the evolution of that particular species then the body is allowed to accumulate damage and senesce. Of course we would still may need to complement the reset of the epigenetic program with repair therapies for the kind of damages that we can not fix naturally like glucosepane crosslinks.

For example there is this study about different species of negligibly senescent see urchins that have very different life spans.

<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12487/abstract>

How would you explain these facts with the damage theory of aging?

About all the SENS therapies in the pipeline which do you think will be the first one to be available to the public? You mention often the 7-ketocholesterol dissolving enzymes but have no further information about possible trials in humans. How would be the process for the SENS foundation developed therapies to be made available to the public? You would sell the rights to interested private companies so they can go on with the human testing?

About OncoSENS I agree with inhibiting telomerase and ALT as an universal cure for cancer. Although I would appreciate some further explanation about the WILT approach to systemically inhibit telomerase in the body and then get an infusion of stem cells every 10 years or so. Would that really be feasible with fast replicating cells like the ones on the gut wall?

For the telomerase inhibition are there already drug candidates? Or if the inhibition is meant to be permanent I asumme some kind of gene editing technique like CRISPR would be a candidate?

Thank you and good luck with the fundraising.

Aubrey de Grey: Regarding aging being driven by damage, see my recent paper <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902458> - email me for full text if you can't get it. The 7KC work is now being pursued in a spin-out startup in which we have a stake. The rate of division of gut stem cells is overstated: it must be very similar to that of the blood and epidermis and lung, because people with telomerase dysfunction get problems in all four places at about the same age. Yes CRISPR.

Q: You recently stated you were disappointed in Calico so far. Have you seen any evidence to change your mind on that view?

Aubrey de Grey: No.

Q: In 2015, NIH has provided over $2.5 billion for projects on 'Aging'.

Seeing $500,000 being given to projects like "A Large Randomized Trial of Vitamin D, Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline", I cannot help but wonder what SENS could achieve with just 1% of what NIH spends on 'Aging' every year. Has SENS tried applying for NIH/NIA grants for its projects?

PS: The full breakdown of NIH grants can be found here: <https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending_project_listing.aspx?FY=2015&ARRA=N&DCat=Aging>

Aubrey de Grey: Yeah... unfortunately, the NIH, like every organisation that allocates research funding via peer review, is hugely biased against high-risk-high-reward work and also multidisciplinary work. We have tried for small grants but it's basically hopeless.

Q: What is the field I should study now to work in human immortality? What should we discover to stop human aging / aquire immortality?

Haroldo Silva: Many discoveries and technological advances need to be made (see Ending Aging). You should work in Biology-related fields of course, but fighting aging is very interdisciplinary. Many fields of science and engineering need to come together to fight age-related diseases.

Q: Recently, there seems to be an uptick in startups focused on reversing aging. Does that seem to be the case to you?

Why do you think this is? What affect are they having on this field as a whole?

Aubrey de Grey: Yes, there certainly are more such startups around, including ones spun out of our own work such as Ichor. It's happening simply because more and more rejuvenation research is getting to a stage of sufficient proof of concept that the more visionary investors are seeing the light at the end of the commercial tunnel.

Q: Dear Dr. de Grey,

I've just finished reading "Cracking the Aging Code" by Josh Mitteldorf and Dorian Sagan and was intrigued by their focus on theories of why aging happens. TL;DR, they attempt to debunk some of the more common theories of aging that all center around entropic decay of the body, in favor of a theory that bodies needn't age at all but are programmed to die (for a number of reasons, but largely as a means of cycling through generations and of managing population size). What do you think of this "programmed to die" theory? It has some wide ranging implications for what to study as an aging researcher, as I feel many projects try to keep a wide array of youthful genes and processes turned on, where perhaps it could be more fruitful to focus on turning off perhaps a very small number of signals that promote aging, and allowing the body to take care of the rest. Thanks!

Aubrey de Grey: See my paper <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902458> for a thorough account of why aging is, unfortunately, not programmed.

Q: Why don't you or another SENS agent schedule meetings with great entrepreneurs and rich people (Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, etc.) to personally introduce SENS's ideas to them and fund future research?

Aubrey de Grey: Do I infer that you are in a position to arrange such a meeting? If so, well volunteered! If not, perhaps there's a reason for that, and it's the same reason why we aren't either.

Q: Hi Aubrey. Your current crowdfunding project relates to inhibiting telomere lengthening in cancerous cells. Aside from this problem of immortal cancer cells, many people seem to think keeping telomeres long in healthy cells is likely to be key to longevity. What's your view of this?

Aubrey de Grey: It's complicated – for sure telomere elongation is beneficial in some ways. If it is indeed detrimental in terms of cancer, the best of both worlds would be to keep telomeres long without giving cells the genetic means to do so themselves. Our approach is to replace short-telomered stem cells with long-telomered ones that still lack telomerase genes.

Haroldo Silva: And to complement what Aubrey said, the long-telomered replacement stem cells would also lack ALT gene(s) once those are found. Our method of testing ALT cancer cells described in our campaign page will also help in finding these genes quickly, but finding small molecules that can inhibit ALT will have a greater impact in the short term by treating cancer patients.

Q: I saw that Craig Venter seems to have only modest healthspan improvement goals and not to support radical life extension. Are you disappointed about that and do you think the work his company is doing is going to provide valuable input anyway?

Aubrey de Grey: That's what he says publicly. Privately I bet he is just as ambitious as me, but he has investors to think about. It remains to be seen what HLI will contribute, but I'm hopeful.

Q: Hi Aubrey, big supporter of your work! Can you give insight on the current SENS campaign on Lifespan.io: <https://www.lifespan.io/campaigns/sens-control-alt-delete-cancer> and your experiences with this type of crowdfunding in general? Particularly:

1) Is the benefit only financial, or do you think these sort of projects are key for raising public awareness?

2) How has your experience been with this campaign and the last one for MitoSENS? Is crowdfunding like this hard? Is it worth it?

3) Is such funding still needed in light of the Project21 announcement?

4) Are there other ways to get involved with this in addition to donating?

Thanks, and keep up the great work!

Aubrey de Grey: The benefit is definitely both financial and awareness-based.

Crowdfunding only brings in a small proportion of our budget (so far!), but the awareness-raising aspect potentially translates into much more money down the road, so I certainly believe it's worth it.

For sure we need every dollar we can get! Project21 is not restricted to large donors. Also, sometimes we get matching funds that are only released when we get other funds too.

The main way to get involved other than donating, unless you're a biologist and can help with the actual research, is in raising awareness. That largely means rebutting the standard concerns that people insist on clinging to.

Q: Have you changed your mind about neuropreservation yet? When it comes to cryonics do you believe you 'get what you pay for' ? How likely do you think it is it will work with the current state of technology - which doesn't seem to have changed all that much for a long time, and are any improvements in the pipeline in terms of methods that will preserve the body with less damage? Also, do you think it will ever be available in Europe?

Aubrey de Grey: There is indeed an improvement in the pipeline that I believe will reduce the amount of damage done during cryopreservation even more dramatically, relative to current methods, than vitrification did relative to freezing. It is called persufflation, and it's being pursued by Arigos, a company formed by Alcor ex-CEO (and SRF's ex-COO) Tanya Jones and her Alcor predecessor Steve Van Sickle. Basically it involves cooling by pumping helium through the vasculature, and it pretty much eliminates fracturing, as well as allowing much faster cooling and thus reducing cryoprotectant toxicity. They are in need of investment - if you're more the investor type than the donor type, please email me and I'll make an intro. Europe - sure, once it works!

Q: Dr. Grey and Dr. Silva, thank you. We appreciate the fact that you've come to discuss these matters with our community.

My question is fairly simple:

Based upon the current trends in multidisciplinary longevity research, your own research, and the ever increasing pace of medical advancement, is it reasonable to expect treatments that aid in obtaining the substantial effects of negligible senescence within the next thirty years or have current efforts lead to unexpected impasses? Is it reasonable to expect a biological solution before a solution based in the digital quantification of consciousness?

Thank you.

Aubrey de Grey: I still think the biological approach is likely to win that race, but I could be wrong, so I'm very happy that others are pursuing other approaches. Yes, 20-30 years is still a good guess; no, there have been no unexpected impasses.

Q: Hello, my question is, do you think there is a limit to how long you can keep the human body going for, even with aging defeated? I wonder when our brain will run out of room for memories... or maybe we will start erasing old memories once we have reached X number of years old?

Also, and this one's more personal, do you think supplement pills and vitamin pills and algae powder pills are worth taking if you already have basic food needs and exercise needs fulfilled? I have heard of people not eating as much vegetables because they think the pills make up for it. Are they making a grave error?

Thank you for your time and generosity.

Aubrey de Grey: No limit, no. We already erase memories – it's called "forgetting"! A varied and balanced diet is always better than relying on supplements.

Q:

1) Would the anti-alt small molecules just prevent the cancer cells from dividing eventually, or would they actually kill the cancer cells?

2) How can you be certain that telomeric C-circles are the only method for cancer cells to achieve ALT? Or that there are a finite number of ways for cells to achieve ALT?

3) Given small molecules often have side effects, why not use an intra-cellular method such as DRACO to target telomeric C-circles and induce apotosis? Or alternatively, do telomeric C-circles present material on MHCs that could be targeted with genetically engineered TCR T cells?

4) Given that an anti ALT therapy will probably be given along with an anti telomerase therapy, won't this affect cell replacement by regular stem cells that can no longer replace tissues for the duration of the treatment? We produce a million new T cells per second, how long can a dual therapy be endured before damaging the subject?

Haroldo Silva:

1) It really depends on how exactly the small molecules we find inhibit the ALT pathway. They could just prevent telomere elongation which will eventually result in complete cessation of tumor growth as you pointed out. On the other hand, these molecules can interfere in the process in such a way as to cause abnormal chromosome fusions which will actually kill cancer cells.

2) C-circles are currently the best biomarker identified to date that is most closely associated with ALT activity. It represents our best chance to help us develop ALT-specific cancer therapies as well as demystify how this mechanism of telomere maintenance works. However, we do not know which specific role(s) C-circles are playing in the ALT pathway. We also do not know how cancer cells initiate ALT activity.

3) C-circles are composed of DNA with the repetitive sequences found at telomeres. Targeting C-circles directly and specifically is not feasible since there is no way to differentiate between C-circles and regular telomeres. Additionally, there is no evidence at present that targeting C-circles would actually inhibit ALT activity. Since C-circles are just DNA strands, they cannot be presented on MHCs for T cell signaling or other stimulation of the immune system.

4) We envision that the side-effects associated with telomerase inhibition will be worked out in the current clinical trials by the time that ALT-specific experimental treatments reach such advanced stages in development. The ALT-specific therapy will of course have no effect on stem cells.

Q: There are lots of Mormons transhumanists, even an association (Mormon Transhumanist Association). Could SENS present conferences to those groups? I think it would help with money.

Aubrey de Grey: I have presented at their conference, and actually that led to meeting Bryan Johnston, founder of Braintree, which was then bought by eBay, leading to Bryan setting up the OS Fund, which has already invested in Human Longevity Inc. Bryan likes us and you never know!

Q: Do you think Facebook / Mark Zuckerberg might become a major player in terms of longevity funding?

Aubrey de Grey: If his wife tells him it's OK ...

Q: Hello I hope this doesn't become a double post I am new to reddit. I tried to remove a similar posting I just did I wanted to rephrase it a bit and add some stuff.

The question is about outreach. I know you spend most of your time doing talks the question is how effective is it and if the right people see them. Or is it mostly people like myself that already seen most of your talks and have a lot of time but little money? Most of the people I know have never heard about either you or SENS. I do not know how involved personally you were in the production of the documentary "the immortalists" but I personally thought it probably did more harm than good because it didn't focus enough on the actual research.

I would suggest a new and more serious documentary with yourself and all the best people in the field and all the latest progress of the research. I would love to see for example George Church in it he's got a nice beard (not as nice as yours ofc) and a good voice for narrating.

So how about it, a new boxoffice smash hit documentary about combatting aging?

Aubrey de Grey: I do masses of interviews that do focus quite a bit on the research, including in very high-profile outlets, and we're always looking for new opportunities.

Q: Thank you for all your hard work, I have been a long time supporter of SENS and have been trying to spread the word!

Doing a drug search against ALT seems like extremely low hanging fruit compared to the complicated therapies currently being developed elsewhere, why hasn't it been pursued before? I know most research has focused on telomerase but ALT seems like such an obvious niche?

What is the timeline for doing the screening if you got the $60k? Say now there isn't a drug in the library that switches off the ALT pathway, are there any useful conclusions that can be drawn?

Dr de Grey, I've heard you criticise the approach taken by Calico, presumably they must be aware of SENS, what do you think their objections to SENS are and their reasoning behind their strategy (investigating what causes aging)?

Aubrey de Grey: ALT has proven really tough to study because its genetic basis is unknown. (We never had that problem with telomerase.) But that's what our ALT project is for! Hence the crowdfunding campaign (and this AMA :-)).

Calico are just slow on the uptake - they are fond of the idea that aging is still a mystery, so they aren't ready to launch into the development of therapies. They'll catch up eventually!

Q: Thank you both for doing this AMA.
I have two questions:

1) I am wondering if chromatin remodelling is a potential way for "reprogramming" the cell, to make it actually younger. My thoughts are that younger cells should not be that vulnerable to "get cancer" at all. There are a few chromatin remodelling proteins out there, but little is know yet. Of course further research has to be done, and i would love to do that. (Working on ALC1 right now)
What do you think about chromatin remodelling?
(One of the papers I read: [DOI:10.1126/science.aaa1356](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/1160))

2) I am always looking for a way to get more involved into deeper age related research. What do you recommend, or can you give me any tips where to go?

Aubrey de Grey: Chromatin structure is a big part of the cell's control of gene expression, so yes, reprogramming necessarily involves chromatin remodelling. But that doesn't imply that cells whose chromatin is "youthfully structured" are immune from mutation.

Q: What do you think of David Sinclairs work? Is he associated with SENS?

Aubrey de Grey: He's not associated with SRF, but he and I are good friends. He's an excellent (and sometimes much-maligned) scientist. I am personally pessimistic that any approach based on mimicking calorie restriction will postpone aging much in humans, but I'll be delighted if he proves me wrong - and even if it only gives a small benefit, that'll still help some people survive long enough for SENS who otherwise wouldn't have.

Q: Hi Dr. Aubrey and Dr. Haroldo, Just curious, I assume yourself being at the forefront of this technology; being able to benefit from it upon its completion to atleast be partly responsible for your interest in the making of biological senescence a relic of humanities past (good choice). But what of those not in such a position? In the ideal scenario where we do soon discover the cure to aging, would you EVER expect the treatments to be available to the general public? How would we make sure such technology wouldn't be abused and people let to suffer for considerable financial gain?

Thanks in advance :)

Haroldo Silva: I do not see how anti-aging treatments would be any different from any other health-related treatments. Once the therapies are approved for clinical use, then they would be available to the general public. I can't fathom a scenario where so many resources are deployed into this effort and then when we find the appropriate therapies, companies and organizations will just keep them for themselves and not disseminate them to anyone else.

Q: Thank you for this, Dr de Grey. While it is unquestionable that damage accumulation will have grave consequences, is it certain that this is the proximal cause of aging? I.e., might this have serious consequences not when we are 75 but 150? Hyperfunction theory (Blagosklonny and others) holds that aging is caused primarily by continued activation of ancient signal transduction pathways evolved for growth and reproduction, long after the period of reproduction has passed.

Aubrey de Grey: Blag's theory is very fashionable right now, but please note that it is not actually in conflict with SENS. There's really no such thing as the "damage theory", because I simply define damage to be the progressive changes in the body's structure that eventually sicken and kill us. If those changes are brought about by inappropriately continued gene expression, so what? - they can still be reversed (repaired).

Q: Hi Aubrey,

First of all, you're a legend.

Hormones are hugely important in helping us grow from babies to adults. Where do hormones fit in the SENS model?

Haroldo, I donated to OncoSENS and wish you god speed. Thanks for doing what you're doing – you're a legend too!

Aubrey de Grey: Hormonal changes during aging are best reversed by rejuvenating the glands that make them, as well as the cells that respond to them.

Thanks for the donation!

Haroldo Silva: Thank you so much for your support!!! We really appreciate it!!! ;-)

Q: UC Irvine evolutionary biologist Dr. Michael Rose has been critical of SENS, claiming it is far too reductionist in its approach (meaning that biology is more than just machinery assembled from parts). How would you respond?

Aubrey de Grey: Well, that's not precisely what he says, but yes, he thinks that his Drosophila findings (specifically the "plateauing" of mortality rates) imply that organisms must have a system for shutting off the accumulation of life-threatening damage. I've explained repeatedly to him, including in print, that this doesn't follow, and that his belief that his results can only be explained that way arises from a basic mathematical error that he made about 20 years ago and has never been willing to admit to, compounded by another one about 10 years ago. It also doesn't help that he holds the additional mistaken belief that evolutionary theory predicts this "late-life non-aging".

Q: What do you think about the recent results indicating mitochondrial stress is sufficient enough to produce cancer by itself? Does this shift the search from a cure away from genetics and towards restoring metabolic function?

<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-07-team-mitochondrial-stress-cancer-related-metabolic.html>

Haroldo Silva: There are certainly metabolic changes that occur once a cell becomes cancerous. However, once a cancer cell emerges it needs to grow and to do that it needs to prevent telomere shortening. This is why we think our ALT-specific approach, in combination with advancements in telomerase-based therapies, have a great potential to treat all forms of cancer. And that is why we are so excited about our crowdfunding campaign.

 Does living longer / indefinitely increase the likelihood that I will die tragically / violently / painfully?

Also, in absolute aggregate, will the technologies you enable increase, decrease, or have no effect on people's emotional well being? (peace, contentment, capacity to love, equanimity etc)

Thanks for your work.

Haroldo Silva: Ask yourself this question: Are people more emotionally distressed now that they live longer than people in say the 19th century? Are you upset that you will most likely live to be 70-80 years old while back in the 'good' old days you could die from tuberculosis in your teens?

Q: Hi Aubrey & Haroldo, there has been articles in some newspapers about several new methods of treating cancer (called immunotherapies) that increase the strength of immune responses against cancer tumors. In general, how do you see the potential of immunotherapies in the fight against cancer? In particular, is there something in the development of those therapies that can also help SENS?

Aubrey de Grey: Very exciting. There are many new approaches to this. Especially check out a new company named Ntercept that is going beyond stimulating the immune system - their approach is to weaken the cancer's defence against the immune system.

Q: Dr. de Grey, could you please comment on the vaccine against Alzheimer's disease that was posed here in [/r/Futurology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology) last week?

Context: [This article](http://www.ibtimes.com.au/alzheimers-breakthrough-vaccine-developed-australian-us-researchers-may-reverse-dementia-alzheimers), published last week, reports a breakthrough in development of a “vaccine” for Alzheimer's disease that will stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that would target the beta amyloids and tau proteins. They claim it can remove the pathological structures and prevent, or even reverse the disease.

It reminded me of your research on repairing accumulated damage, and I would like to know your opinion on it. Do you think this particular approach is on the right track cure Alzheimer's, or do you think there are some other causes or obstacles they didn't take into consideration?

Aubrey de Grey: This is the latest in a wide range of immunotherapy approaches for removing amyloid and tau. It's early-stage, but it may prove useful.

Q: Do you find that PR on curated media, like techie sites, leads to more donors or mainstream broadcasting like television shows?

Will we always need to change public opinion to build a driving, consumer demand or will industry invest enthusiastically after mouse trial results, whether or not the public is terribly moved by them?

Aubrey de Grey: I'm not sure which leads to more – I think it's cumulative – many donors need to hear the message many times before they become convinced enough to actually give. Industry will certainly invest - indeed, that's already starting to happen.

Q: Hello Sirs. I have a degree in biochemistry (U.K.) and I have spent the last few years doing industrial work (bioreactors mostly), but I'm thinking of pursuing a masters degree in biotechnology in order to further my involvement in the field of age-related treatment. Is this actually a good choice? How in your opinion should a person in my position direct their efforts for a maximally fruitful outcome?

Haroldo Silva: You should find a scientist who is doing work you admire in the field of aging research and then try to get into that lab to do research as a graduate student.

Q: Dr. De Grey, thanks so much for answering questions. You've said a number of times you think there's at least a 10 percent chance we won't reach sens 1.0 therapies for 100 years. What do you think is the most likely event that will occur soon that could bring that figure down a good amount?

Aubrey de Grey: That's the wrong question – the right question is, what will bring down the number of years before we have a 50% chance of getting there? And the answer to that is, the event will be the donation of a lot of money to our research. Boring but true...

Q: Say we effectively end aging. How do you see the world coping with a much longer-lived population?

Aubrey de Grey: See the study we funded recently:

Q: Hi Aubrey. How optimistic do you feel about the potential of Senolytics, such as the ones which are going to be tested in the Major Mouse Testing Project?

Aubrey de Grey: Quite promising, but it won't surprise me if it turns out to be hard or impossible to find drugs that kill a lot of senescent cells without also damaging a lot of other cells. That's why we've always been keen on a genetic approach, called suicide gene therapy, whereby cells are infected with a gene that is turned on when the cell becomes senescent and creates a toxic protein. A company we're closely associated with, named Oisin, is spearheading that approach now.

Q: Dr. De Grey, I constantly advocate for your work, and donate money myself. But the people I talk to aren't fully on board with what you do. I try to reason the best I can with people about why your work should be important to everyone. But people just seem to look past and don't make a sincere effort to give SENS the benefit of the doubt. How can I become more persuasive at getting people to understand why your work is critical? It seems like people bear the attitude that if it were that feasible, more people would be working on it already.

Aubrey de Grey: I wish there were an easy answer! The basic problem is the herd mentality – people know that if we could fix aging we would, but they also know that "everyone" thinks we can't, so even if they can't see any fatal flaw in your argument,it's easier for them to conclude that they are missing one than that "everyone" is just wrong. The only solution to that is new data and repeat advertising.

Q: Are you encouraged by recent advances in matters like 3D printing organs / tissue or creating artificial organs such as the heart developed by Carmat? Do you think either or both these approaches will become important?

Aubrey de Grey: Yes, this kind of work is certainly encouraging – indeed, we were the first investor in Organovo. But eventually we will seek to phase out all interventions that involve surgery.

Q: Which ones of the seven damages of aging do you think will be "easiest" to fix and which one will be the most difficult? Which one have you come the furthest with?

Aubrey de Grey: Extracellular garbage seems to be the easiest – vaccination of one sort or another basically just does it. Cancer is the hardest.
