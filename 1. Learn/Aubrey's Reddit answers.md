#### [2016.09.09 - Reddit - Futurology - Aubrey de Grey & Matthew O'Connor AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/51wpds/aubrey_de_grey_matthew_oconnor_ama/)

I am Dr. Aubrey De Grey, biologist, gerontologist PhD and author of the book Ending Aging and Chief Science Officer at the **SENS Research Foundation**. I am here with researcher Dr. Matthew O'Connor from the **MitoSENS** project who is an expert on "allotopic expression" of mitochondrial genes. His team has been working on engineering mitochondrial genes to be expressed from the nucleus and targeted to the mitochondia as part of the MitoSENS approach to one of the damages of aging.

*Each cell in the body is dependent on the efficient generation of cellular energy by mitochondria to stay alive. Critical to this process are genes encoded within the mitochondrial genome. Over time however, mutations in these genes occur as a result of constant exposure to reactive oxygen species produced by oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial energy generation process. Unlike genes within the nucleus, mitochondria lack an efficient system to repair damaged DNA. This leads to accumulated mutations, resulting in mitochondrial defects and an increase in oxidative stress throughout the body. Closely correlated with this is the observation that organisms which age more slowly also consistently display lower rates of mitochondrial free radical damage. Thus, reversing and/or preventing damage to mitochondrial DNA may be a key factor in slowing the aging process.*

The SENS Research Foundation recently published very positive data the result of a community fundraiser at **[Lifespan.io](https://www.lifespan.io/)** showing that the MitoSENS approach is viable. If you would like to read our published paper you can do so **[here](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/04/nar.gkw756)**.

This research is a huge step forward for aging research and our understanding of aging and the approaches we can apply to it. If you would like to learn more about the SENS Research Foundation please visit **[www.sens.org](http://www.sens.org/)**

Q: CRISPR gene editing has quickly become the breakthrough technology of the year, accurate and powerful, implemented in science labs all over the world.

Wouldn't it be the most straightforward solution to simply edit out the genes responsible for genetic diseases and insert in the genes associated with extreme health and longevity, and almost immunity to cancer, as those living in the blue zones have?

Aubrey de Grey: Short answer: no, both because there are innumerably many such genes and because the differences between different gene variants only modestly alter the rate of damage creation. Longevity in the blue zones is only a few years better than elsewhere.

Q: How long do you think it will take before we can reverse surface level aging : hair loss, gray hair & wrinkles? Which of the 7 damages types do we need to solve to make it happen?

Aubrey de Grey: Wrinkles are mainly from crosslinking, an area that was pretty much stalled for 20 years until our breakthrough publication in Science last October; still a way to go but we're now making rapid progress. Hair loss and grey hair are mostly a cell loss problem, and rejuvenating the epidermal stem cell population (as well as melanocytes specifically) is something a lot of people are making good progress on; check out the work of Elaine Fuchs and Fiona Watt and Colin Jahoda especially.

Q: Hello Dr. De Grey and Dr, O'Connor, I congratulate you with great results. Thank you so much for pushing longevity science forward!

Could you please tell what will be the next stage of the MitoSENS project, are you going to try to reproduce mitochondrial gene relocation in animals?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Looks like there are several variations on this question so I'll try to tackle them here: yes we want to take this into animals next and yes we are starting now. I don't have any results to share yet but we are in the very earliest stages of pre-mouse work now. We are working in mouse cells to make sure that we can get our process working in cells before we move into whole mice.

Q: Hi Dr. De Grey and Dr. O'connor. Are you guys considering or taking advantage of the power of deep learning to accelerate your research into aging?

Aubrey de Grey: We are definitely interested in this. Alex Zhavoronkov, one of our foremost associates, now runs a company named Insilico Medicine which is spearheading that approach. Also, Demis Hassabis (head of Deepmind) and I have been friends for 20 years (since he was an undergraduate at Cambridge).

Q: I read *Ending Aging* about 5 years ago. What progress has been made toward Robust Mouse Rejuvenation (RMR) since then? Is there progress that has been contributed by Dr. O'Connor's work?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: There was a cool paper published - i think in science last year, that revealed more of the mechanism of co-translational import of mito genes that we are also studying to try to improve our targeting/import.

Q: How can grassroots activism most effectively be leveraged to hasten the defeat of aging?

Aubrey de Grey: The key thing is to tackle both feasibility and desirability together, which paradoxically means tackling them separately. People are scared to get their hopes up, and they dismiss the feasibility issue because they have already decided that success would be a bad idea, and at the same time they dismiss the desirability issue because they have already decided that the whole concept is a pipe dream. So, first force your interlocutor into understanding that that linkage is logically absurd and thus into addressing the two questions separately. Then, give them the best arguments; you can get those from my voluminous output.

Q: I would like to ask Oki, now we have great results how long do you think it will be before we can do the same with the other 11 genes and are these genes technically any more or less challenging than the two already done?

Great progress so far so what is the next step in terms of development moving towards the clinic?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Great question. Yes, there is reason to believe that some of the other 11 will be harder than ATP8 and ATP6. In fact, ATP6 is itself much harder than ATP8 and our results with that aren't as strong as with ATP8. We have some technologies that we've tested already that seem to work a bit with the harder genes and we're layering on additional levels of mitochondrial targeting and import. The hard thing is how complicated it gets when we start combining multiple targeting strategies together and quantifying their affects. We are building a rigorous system so that we can test variables in a matrix and clearly determine what works and what doesn't.

Q: Ok, I'm going to throw a bit of a curveball. Your technology seems to be able to deal with mutations that are full deletions of mitochondrial DNA genes, but what about mitochondrial diseases that are caused by point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA? Won't these misfolded proteins still being produced compete with the corrected proteins now being produced by your imported RNA?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: This is a hard question. We don't really know how effectively our engineered genes will compete with existing mutant (or non-mutant for that matter) proteins. We and others have done some work on it, but the answers aren't satisfying for me yet. We are at the conceptual stages of designing a rigorous method of quantifying this. Not clear that mutant proteins much exist in "normal" aging though, so it might be a non-issue for aging but a very important question for inherited mito disease.

Aubrey de Grey: Augmenting what Oki said: recently a new mouse model has been developed that accumulates deletions at an accelerated rate. It is a "binary system" that allows the problem to be activated in a tissue-specific manner by crossing with specific other mice, so it's very versatile. I expect that it will be quite useful.

The point mutation mice are not all that paradoxical really, because they tend to accumulate mutations in stem cells (in the gut etc) and the effect on tissue function may be pretty mild jut because those cells don't need much OXPHOS.

Q: Hello Dr. De Grey, Love your work!

From what I understand you used to be an engineer working on A.I research before you self taught yourself biology and became a gerontologist.

so my question is, If someone wanted to follow in your footsteps and fight aging. What would they need to do to self learn biology? assuming that for various reasons they cant learn it officially in a university.

Aubrey de Grey: I never advise people to try to follow my career path, because it involved such an insane amount of sheer unadulterated luck that there is no way anyone could. The right way to think about this is the same as with regard to learning a skill: it's not the facts you learn that matter, so much as the ability to learn new facts quickly and efficiently later on. Similarly here, the right thing is to look hard at your own circumstances and options and consider how they most promisingly lead to a place you want to reach. The best route for you will almost certainly not resemble the route that I or anyone else you might pick took.

Q: Thank you for doing this AMA, Aubrey de Grey & Matthew O'Connor!

1) Do you think we will see major steps and results in mice in the next 5 years?

2) Do you expect to see a generation 1 therapies within 30 years?

3) what's your thoughts on Mind Uploading?

4) Ray Kurzweil have made some confident predictions. He believes we only 10-12 years to reach Longevity Escape Velocity. Do you agree with him or Is his prediction too optimistic?

Aubrey de Grey: 1) Yes, there's a chance of that; I'd say in 6-8 years there's at least a 50% chance. And by "major" I mean RMR, i.e. seriously life-extending interventions that start in middle age.

2) Yes - my current 50% prediction is 20-25 years.

3) I don't think about it much.

4) A factor of two difference in technological timeframe predictions is not much of a disagreement!

I would add that we might see human gene therapies in patients with mitochondria disease in much shorter periods of time. If these work the chances of it working on aging increase dramatically!

Q: Where would be the best place to start to get into longevity? That is, what should one read up on, and what can one do now to increase ones healthy long life?

Aubrey de Grey: Read all the introductory material at sens.org Then read Ending Aging Then read the research papers we highlight at sens.org (our own and also those of other labs)

Q: Is it ever too late to start studying microbiology? What are some things an aspiring longevity researcher should take into account before dedicating themselves to such a cause?

Aubrey de Grey: No, never too late - whether microbiology, molecular biology or any other biology. The main thing to take into account when starting out is that you shouldn't specialise too soon, because aging affects the body at every level of organisation, hence to have the best insighhts you need a god grounding in every area of biology.

Q: Robert K. Naviaux, mitochondrial expert, asserts that their dual (or even primary) function is as an exquisitely sensitive alarm system, triggering the '[cell danger response](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567724913002390)' (CDR) to chemical or microbial threats. Also, that oxidative stress is a misguided target for therapies, in many chronic diseases, as it is more like a protective '[oxidative shielding](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/342/3/608.long)' response (to an underlying problem).

(1) How does this sit with the understanding so far in the MitoSENS project? Complement, contradict, unknown? I'm certainly no expert, and negating mitochondrial DNA damage sounds like a definite win, but could allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins truncate the CDR detrimentally? Or conversely might this innate immune functionality trip up your efforts?

I ask this as a person with chronic fatigue (CFS), since Naviaux just published [a promising metabolomics study](http://m.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/24/1607571113.full) which seems like a turning point in understanding our neglected disease. They found common indicators in subjects characteristic of hypometabolism that he describes as most similar to a 'dauer' state (which, in worms, greatly increases longevity at great cost to function, to survive extreme environmental stresses). Being stuck in a protective hypometabolic state would seem to fit well with the known reduction in our cellular energy (ATP) production, often increased oxidative stress and other idiosyncrasies, since [no causative mitochondrial mutations have been found - mutations only corresponding with symptom variety](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-0771-6). Manifesting as heterogeneous problems, like our many varied initial triggers, but perhaps a homogeneous mechanism.

(2) At a reach, does any of your work give any insight on turning off CDR states, [apparently active in developing autism](http://naviauxlab.ucsd.edu/science-item/autism-research/), ADHD, Alzheimer's, etc, or escaping our CFS hypometabolism?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Reading this quickly I'm going to give a snap reply that our mitoSENS project might not help this kind of "homeostasis" problem, if that problem isn't caused by the loss of mito encoded genes. Mitochondrial are indeed complex organelles with much cross-talk with the rest of the cell so our philosophy is always that the underlying problem needs to be addressed. If the problem is in the nuclear genes then that's what needs to be fixed. If the problem is in the lysosome - resulting in reduced mito turnover then we need to fix the lysosome rather than the mitochondria.

Aubrey de Grey: Exactly. It is often forgotten that mitochondria are constantly recycled even in non-dividing cells, and thus that the only damage they can possibly accumulate other than as a side-effect of something extramitochondrial is DNA damage, and only then if somehow mutant mtDNA is selected for. Historical aside: after Harman first suggested the role of mitochondria in aging in 1972, the only published reaction by anyone prominent was that Alex Comfort in 1976 rejected it on exactly this basis. He did not, of course, consider the bizarre possibility that mutant mtDNA could be selected for, which was only shown in 1993.

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Oxygen radicals are indeed used in cell signaling pathways so we can't just turn anti-oxidation up to 11, prevent all damage and call it a day. That's why we are building a system that can cope with damage and is amenable to continued treatments. Like aubrey's car maintenance analogy.

Q: Has Calico reached out to you and your team at all? I used to think that they would just be data focused (leveraging Google's greatest strength), but after they brought on Cynthia Kenyon, I'm not so sure. Why do you think they have not been more aggressive in the seven areas outlined in SENS?

Aubrey de Grey: We reached out to Calico very energetically when they were getting going but they basically blew us off. We are dismayed that they are not taking advantage of our expertise. Maybe they will start to do so eventually.

Q: Dr. De Grey, you've mentioned that SENS 1.0 therapies, when perfected, will add maybe around 30 years of healthy lifespan. Does that mean that it's impossible for them to work indefinitely long without needing any improvements? If so, why?

Aubrey de Grey: Yes, that's what it means. Here's an example that may explain it: crosslinking. Once we are able to break glucosepane, we'll be able to reduce crosslinking by a big factor - for sake of argument let's say 50% - but we won't be breaking any other crosslinks. Thus, eventually the total amount of crosslinking will return to old-age levels even if we blitz the glucosepane every year. So, we need to carry on with the introduction of therapies that hit the next most abundant link, and the next, etc.

Q: Will progress on mitosens be quicker now with the initial breakthrough you've made? How would this therapy be administered once as available? And how are billions of cells treated by a one off treatment?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Yes, I think our unambiguous results will make a big splash. Gene therapy. Gene therapies are designed to target many cells at a time. Billions of cells aren't really as many as they sound. The harder part is getting your gene therapy into all the nooks and crannies of organs.

Q: I want to ask about the potential for CRISPR to impact longevity research.

It would be nice if CRISPR or any other gene editing technique was able to, safely, edit the genes of a mature, living mammal rather than just cells in a petri dish. Could CRISPR potentially do this? If so, is CRISPR accurate enough? If such a gene therapy technique did exist, how would it impact longevity research and what do you think would be the most interesting applications? (adding gene repair proteins to the genome? extending telomeres? repairing mutations?)

Thanks.

Also I'd like to thank Aubrey for inspiring me to pursue a career in science with his TED talk in 2005. I am now completing my masters in chemistry and applying to PhD programs!

Aubrey de Grey: Great to hear I inspired you - thanks for mentioning that. CRISPR is getting very, very error-free now, so I am sure it will be a big tool in implementing SENS. We have developed a way to use it in combination with a bacterial virus; our method allows the insertion of lots of DNA (even up to 100kb potentially) in one go, into a defined location on the chromosome, so we would aim to do all the aspects of SENS that require new genes that way - mtDNA backups of course, but also enzymes to degrade waste products, and suicide genes to eliminate death-resistant toxic cells.

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: This is a good question. The short answer is that mito targeting CRISPR (and other similar gene editing tech) might be less valuable for aging than for congenital mito disease, but might be valuable for creating tools for us to use in our experiments

Q: I read somewhere that even if CRISPR is getting super accurate, reaching the trillions of cells in a human body is still an issue. What strategies are being developed to solve that problem and how far from a solution are we?

Aubrey de Grey: This is actually two sides of the same coin. Increased accuracy means a lower probability that a given CRISPR construct will do a bad thing, which in turn means that we can introduce more constructs (whether all at the same time or over repeated administrations) while remaining at an acceptable risk of bad things, which in turn means we can hit more cells.

Q: How old do you think the youngest person is today that will never have a chance to benefit from the coming longevity revolution?

Aubrey de Grey: I prefer to answer the converse question, how old is the oldest person who WILL benefit! I still think that person could be in their 60s, or even 70 now. Remember, though, that that will be a person who would naturally live to 110 without SENS.

Q: Now you have enjoyed two successful campaigns on Lifespan.io and it is looking like rejuvenation biotechnology is becoming more appreciated by the public, do you feel using platforms like Lifespan.io is more effective for funding/promoting individual projects than the general fundraising methods you have employed traditionally?

Would you consider running another lifespan.io campaign soon and if so what area of SENS do you think it would be?

Aubrey de Grey: We must always remember that the magnitude of the crowdfunding campaigns that we have conducted so far is only a small proportion of our existing budget, let alone our desired budget. Yes it may grow, but we're not seeing much sign of that yet. But still, every dollar surely helps! Anyone who's thinking of donating to the ALT campaign, please don't be put off by the fact that we just made our target - it's still open.

Q: Hello Dr. de Grey,

It seems recently there's been a bit more attention into anti-aging/gerentology research from mainstream research institutions. How has that affected the work you do at SENS, if at all? Further, some of this research covers topics SENS has advocated for, some of it doesn't. What kind of value, if any, do you see in the research that comes at anti-aging from different lines of thought?

Thanks!

Aubrey de Grey: It's huge that really respected people like Venter and Diamandis are in this now, as well as really respected companies like Google. It's making a lot of previously skeptical people take notice, and we are hopeful that it will soon translate into better funding - we really need that. As for variety of lines of thought, sure, the more the better: the main problem SENS had in years past in gaining general expert acceptance was that too many experts had already become wedded to particular prior ideas.

Q: Hi Aubrey, long time fan and early supporter of you here!

My questions are about the recent mitosens accomplishment.

How fast do you think you can move those other 11 mito genes to the nucleus?

What increase in health and lifespan can we expect from solving this 1 out of 7?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: 1) We are trying to build a system that is generalizable to all 13 genes. We still need a breakthrough or two before we get there. The good news is that since we have a good idea about which genes are the most difficult that we will know when we are there.

2) In short, no, we need to do them all separately. With regards Q2 and 5, maybe there will be synergistic health affects of applying more than 1, but less than 7 fundamental rejuvenations, but we won't know until we try. There is some evidence that just tampering with mitochondria can improve the health of old rodents.

Q: Back at the outset of the SENS research programs, the estimated cost to prototype allotopic expression of all 13 oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial genes in mice was ~$150M and ten years. At this point, MitoSENS has had probably something like a $10-15M investment (very fuzzy number) on the part of SRF, Gensight investors, other teams, etc, carried out over what is now getting on for ten years, and 3-and-a-bit of the 13 genes have been moved to the nucleus.

What is your current thinking on remaining costs and time now that the project is 20-25% of the way towards a prototype?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: We've spent a lot less than $10M on this project so far. Total from all groups working in the field must be much much more than $15M. I will get it working in mice for much less than $150M.

Q: Any plans to translate the research into a gene therapy for a specific inherited mitochondrial disease?

I know only one gene therapy has been approved in Europe as of earlier this year (and none in USA as far as I know feel free to correct me), so I was wondering if there's any chance this can be used as media leverage for SENS - in the future of course going from research to the clinic takes a lot of time I know.

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Well to get into the nitty gritty a little bit - there are exceedingly few patients who have been discovered to have mutations specific to ATP8 - less than 5 that I know of. ATP6 has more, but still very few. The gene therapy advancement that needs to happen is to get gene therapy tech approved that can be used outside of the eye. Then it will be easier to get these individual mito gene therapies approved.

Q: Hello Dr. De Gray and Dr. O'Connor can you tell us how do you plan to regenerate bones and degenerative changes on those. I understand that soft tissue is easier to repair what about skeleton?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: As far as I know, mito mutations aren't thought to cause problems with bone, which seems confusing since it's a slowly or non-growing tissue. Mito problems tend to be more exaggerated in slow growing tissues so it's not clear to me why this is the case - but bone tentatively seems not to be a problem we need to worry about too too much for mitos.

Q: Dear Dr. O'Connor, first off, congratulations! Successful translocation of ATP6 and ATP8 genes was a great acheivement. However, your mitoSENS paper closes with the following words of caution to the overly optimistic:

> We do not wish to claim, based purely our results, that this approach would be effective using any or all of the mitochondrially encoded proteins. We achieved the greatest success with ATP8, which is also the smallest mitochondrially encoded protein. ATP6, while much larger than ATP8, is still one of the smaller proteins normally translated inside of the mitochondria. Other groups have published results demonstrating difficulty in importing other proteins into the mitochondria (24,25). Indeed, our group has thus far failed, after many attempts, to express and import CYB into the mitochondria (data not shown). We hope, however, that with careful experimentation and additional levels of targeting (such as RNA targeting to promote co-translational import) (5,62), that this approach will someday become generalized to any of the 13 proteins of the mitochondrial genome. <http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/04/nar.gkw756.full>

If I understand correctly, the CYB protein is about 50% larger than ATP6. After your "many failed attempts", do you now have an understanding of what is preventing its import into the mitochondria, and, if so, what can be done to work around it?

Also, for the remaining 10 (or 11 if you count CYB) MT proteins, do you think we have a workable mechanism of importing them into the MT, should we succeed in incorporating their genes into the nuclear DNA?

Thanks!

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: Yeah, so CYB is both bigger and thought to be more "hydrophobic" than other mito proteins. I really like working on CYB though for 2 reasons: One is that I think that once we solve CYB we will have solved all 13. The other is that CYB is the only mito encoded subunit of OxPhos complex III, which makes it a very simple system to study. We have cells that are null for CYB (similar to, but more simple than the cells that we used in the current publication) so we have a great system to test our innovations in.

Q: How do newly formed embryos avoid being born old with a high percentage of damaged mitochondria?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: There are 2 levels of natural selection at work here. 1 is that deleterious mutations can be selected against during mitochondrial replication - which occurs more frequently in rapidly dividing cells - which is the situation you have during a rapidly growing embryo. The second level is the survival of the embryo. It has been estimated that 1 in 200 people are born with >1% of their mitochondria containing "significant" mutations.

Q: Hi Drs De Grey and O'Connor. Do you think that allotopically expresing ATP6 and ATP8 could have a measurable life extension effect in mice? Or it's more probable that all 13 genes must be allotopically expresed in order to see some improvement? Would you recommend to check this now under the MMTP with only 2 genes?

Dr. Matthew O' Connor: I think we would need to do all 13 to get some health affect in normal animals, but there might be some tricks we can use to get it to work on some mutant mouse models.
