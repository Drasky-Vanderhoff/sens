### Sam Harris

##### [2017.02.16 - Waking Up with Sam Harris #64 â€” Ask Me Anything 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMTuquaAC4w&t=43m15s)
- He discusses Aubrey from 43:15 to 50:49.
- He seems somewhat--but not thoroughly--knowledgeable of Aubrey's ideas.
- He slightly misrepresents the "Longevity Escape Velocity" concept, conflating it with Aubrey's claim that the first person to live to 1000 is already alive. Aubrey in fact is *not* saying that anyone alive today has *already* achieved LEV; LEV refers to something that Aubrey suspects *can / will* happen, not something that has *already* happened.
