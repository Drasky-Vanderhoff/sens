### Sam Harris

- He discusses Aubrey from 43:15 to 50:49.
- He seems somewhat--but not thoroughly--knowledgeable of Aubrey's ideas.
- He slightly misrepresents the "Longevity Escape Velocity" concept, conflating it with Aubrey's claim that the first person to live to 1000 is already alive. Aubrey in fact is *not* saying that anyone alive today has *already* achieved LEV; LEV refers to something that Aubrey suspects *can / will* happen, not something that has *already* happened.

### Elon Musk

##### [2015.05.07 - WaitButWhy - Elon Musk: The World’s Raddest Man](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html)
> In college, he thought about what he wanted to do with his life, using as his starting point the question, “What will most affect the future of humanity?” The answer he came up with was a list of five things: “the internet; sustainable energy; space exploration, in particular the permanent extension of life beyond Earth; artificial intelligence; and reprogramming the human genetic code.”
> 
> (...)
> 
> I talked to him for a while about genetic reprogramming. He doesn’t buy the efficacy of typical anti-aging technology efforts, because he believes humans have general expiration dates, and no one fix can help that. He explained: “The whole system is collapsing. You don’t see someone who’s 90 years old and it’s like, they can run super fast but their eyesight is bad. The whole system is shutting down. In order to change that in a serious way, you need to reprogram the genetics or replace every cell in the body.” Now with anyone else—literally anyone else—I would shrug and agree, since he made a good point. But this was Elon Musk, and Elon Musk fixes shit for humanity. So what did I do?
> 
> Me: Well…but isn’t this important enough to try? Is this something you’d ever turn your attention to?
> 
> Elon: The thing is that all the geneticists have agreed not to reprogram human DNA. So you have to fight not a technical battle but a moral battle.
> 
> Me: You’re fighting a lot of battles. You could set up your own thing. The geneticists who are interested—you bring them here. You create a laboratory, and you could change everything.
> 
> Elon: You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it’s like—how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don’t know.
> 
> Me: I think there’s a way. You’ve said before about Henry Ford that he always just found a way around any obstacle, and you do the same thing, you always find a way. And I just think that that’s as important and ambitious a mission as your other things, and I think it’s worth fighting for a way, somehow, around moral issues, around other things.
> 
> Elon: I mean I do think there’s…in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues, we are going to have to reprogram our DNA. That’s the only way to do it.
> 
> Me: And deep down, DNA is just a physical material.
> 
> Elon: [Nods, then pauses as he looks over my shoulder in a daze] It’s software.
> 
> Comments:
> 
> 1) It’s really funny to brashly pressure Elon Musk to take on yet another seemingly-insurmountable task and to act a little disappointed in him that he’s not currently doing it, when he’s already doing more for humanity than literally anyone on the planet.
> 
> 2) It’s also super fun to casually brush off the moral issues around genetic programming with “I think there’s a way” and to refer to DNA—literally the smallest and most complex substance ever—as “just a physical material deep down” when I have absolutely no idea what I’m talking about. Because those things will be his problem to figure out, not mine.
> 
> 3) I think I’ve successfully planted the seed. If Musk takes on human genetics 15 years from now and we all end up living to 250 because of it, you all owe me a drink.
