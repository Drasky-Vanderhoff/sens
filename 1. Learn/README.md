#### Background
- The idea for this directory is to collect all the information needed to decide what course of action to take.
#### Tips
- To search just this directory from GitHub, use the search bar at the top of the page and add `path:"1. Learn"` before whatever term you want to search for. ([Source](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/))
  - Example: `path:"1. Learn" Calico`
  - Note that GitHub's search is *exact*, so a search for "population" will not return results for "overpopulation".
  - GitHub's search also does not support wildcards (*).
