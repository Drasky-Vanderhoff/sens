- [2013.09.18 - TIME - Opinion by Aubrey de Grey - Google’s Calico: the War on Aging Has Truly Begun](http://ideas.time.com/2013/09/18/finally-the-war-on-aging-has-truly-begun-2/)
  - In his 2014.07.28 talk at Google he says he was approached by Time to write this in reaction to the announcement of Calico (it was announced via Time magazine).
  - *"Now is the right time for a commercial entity to get heavily involved. (...) With Google’s decision to direct its astronomical resources to a concerted assault on aging, that battle may have been transcended: once financial limitations are removed, curmudgeons no longer matter. That’s why I think it is no exaggeration to state that the end of the beginning may have arrived. I won’t go so far as to say that my crusading job is done, but for sure it just got a whole lot easier."*

  - He discusses the then-recent announcement of Calico
- [2015.12.28 - Quora - Aubrey's answer to "Does SENS Research Foundation have plans to start collaborating with, or to collaborate more closely with Calico, Human Longevity Inc., and/or Alcor Life Extension Foundation?"](https://www.quora.com/Does-SENS-Research-Foundation-have-plans-to-start-collaborating-with-or-to-collaborate-more-closely-with-Calico-Human-Longevity-Inc-and-or-Alcor-Life-Extension-Foundation)
  - [Aubrey:] Calico: we hope so, but **they have basically blown us off so far**. They are being quite secretive about their plans, but **from the range of people they are hiring they have not yet really got the message that damage repair is the way to go**.
- [2016.11.24 - Quora - Aubrey's answer to "How is SENS research on longetivity different from Calico (owned by Google)?"](https://www.quora.com/How-is-SENS-research-on-longetivity-different-from-Calico-owned-by-Google)
  - [Aubrey:] Calico are being quite tight-lipped about their activities (as most private companies that don't need to raise money tend to be!), so to some extent one can only guess. But **from their pattern of hiring, it's a good bet that they are focusing on trying to understand aging better, as a step towards figuring out how to postpone it**. That's not surprising when you have a chief science officer (David Botstein) who is on public record that he doesn't have a translational bone in his body, but **it's unfortunate, because the field has moved on from that attitude and it is now entirely orthodox to think in terms of intervention based on what is already known about aging, i.e. without finding out any more fundamental truths**. We have of course tried to educate them on this, but **thus far they have basically blown us off**.
- [2016.11.24 - Quora - Aubrey's answer to "Why doesn't Larry Page of Alphabet Inc. give Aubrey de Grey's SENS Research Foundation all the money it needs to do what must be done?"](https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Larry-Page-of-Alphabet-Inc-give-Aubrey-de-Greys-SENS-Research-Foundation-all-the-money-it-needs-to-do-what-must-be-done)
  - [Aubrey:] An even better question would be "Why didn't he donate a decade ago when Peter Thiel did?" In September 2005 there was a small dinner party hosted by Peter at the Four Seasons in San Francisco, which was the first time the either I or Cynthia Kenyon had met either Peter or Larry. Since then, Peter has funded SENS to the tune of around $6M (though for sure we wish he'd give more!), and Cynthia to a much lesser degree. Larry has gone the other way (insofar as Cynthia is now at Calico). Neither Peter nor Larry has been short of relevant scientific information. So **I guess the message is that there is no way to understand the decision-making process of wealthy people**.
- [2016.12.15 - MIT Technology Review - Google’s Long, Strange Life-Span Trip](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603087/googles-long-strange-life-span-trip/)
  - **Botstein says a “best case” scenario is that Calico will have something profound to offer the world in 10 years.** That time line explains why the company declines media interviews. “There will be nothing to say for a very long time, except for some incremental scientific things. That is the problem.”
- [2017.04.28 - Vox - Google is super secretive about its anti-aging research. No one knows why.](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research)
