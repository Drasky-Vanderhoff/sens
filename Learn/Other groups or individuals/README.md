The idea here is to gather information about other groups (like Calico) or individuals (like Ray Kurzweil), with the expectation that it will in some way be useful.

For example, one way it could be useful is for understanding the situations / positions of these other groups and using that information to try to influence which research they decide to allocate money to.
