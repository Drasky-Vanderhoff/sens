  Hi Lloyd,

  I just saw your most-recent video (Q217 - Q12: Healthy body or healthy mind?) and thought that it was the perfect excuse to ask you something I'd been wanting to ask for a while:

  Please consider doing a video about Aubrey de Grey and SENS!

  He seems brilliant to me (he has a PhD from the University of Cambridge), but the implications of his ideas are so far beyond people's everyday experience that he seems to have trouble getting people to pay attention to what he's saying.

  You can see a recent TED talk that he gave here.

  If you're short on time, his main ideas are that:
  bodies are analogous to machines like cars when it comes to aging, in that...
  age-related diseases are a result of wear-and-tear damage that accumulates in the body over the course of our lives, and...
  current research into fighting age-related disease focuses on how to try to stop the damage from happening in the first place (analogous to trying to modify a car to never accumulate wear-and-tear) rather than how to repair the damage (analogous to 'routine preventative maintenance').
  if we can get people to fund the right research, we have a '50% chance' of being able to add 30 years of healthy life to currently-middle-aged adults, and...
  if we can achieve that first 30 years, we have a very good chance of being able to 'continue to kick the can down the road' as new breakthroughs allow people to live longer and longer.

  He runs a nonprofit called SENS which takes in donations and allocates the money to research that he has judged crucial-but-ignored. Their current budget is $4 million/year, but he thinks they could be allocating $50 million/year and thus moving three times as quickly.

  I'm also trying to organize information here to be used to help raise money for the research he wants to fund.
