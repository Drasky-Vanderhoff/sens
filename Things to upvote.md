##### The comment
Hi all, there's a project to organize SENS information via GitHub so it's easy for people to help SENS in a somewhat-coordinated way (for example using the right language and trying to persuade people in an effective way). If you're interested in helping, the project is located at https://github.com/NathanWailes/SENS.
