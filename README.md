# What's this all about?
In short: It's about "ending aging": developing therapies to treat all age-related diseases, which would allow people to live for thousands of years.

[SENS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategies_for_Engineered_Negligible_Senescence) stands for *Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence*. It's a fancy way of saying "Ways to stop the health problems associated with having been alive a long time", or even more simply, "How to end aging". As you can read on the Wikipedia entry for SENS, it's a term coined by a guy named [Aubrey de Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey), who studied [the biology of aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology#Biogerontology) at the extremely-prestigious [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge).

# The current situation
The current goal is to get SENS's funding to [$50 million/year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=9m32s) from its current level of $4 million/year, so that it can be diverted to crucial research that is now possible but not being done for lack of funding.

##### Explanation
[Aubrey has said]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=2m21s)) that when he first decided to tackle aging, he foresaw three major problems:
1. Figuring out how to fix aging, or in other words, coming up with a plan of research that would lead to therapies that would prevent *all* age-related diseases. ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=2m45s))
1. Convincing the researchers necessary to execute the plan that it was worth their time. ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=2m59s))
1. Convincing the funders of research that it was worth spending money on. ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=3m18s))

Aubrey found the first problem ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=3m26s)) and second problem ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=5m38s)) to be easier-than-anticipated, and they were essentially solved within a few years (by [2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=7m25s)).

Since then, "it's all been about problem number three: the funding" ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=7m45s)). [Aubrey estimates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5bes7z4Lg&t=9m32s) that the necessary research could be done three times faster if SENS had ten times more money (so, $40-50 million/year).
